Trained on MeasEval 2021 SemEval data which focuses on Counts and Measurements entities in clinical texts. (Can be extended to other medical entities as well)

Using PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext as a backbone so can capture token level information corresponding to medical texts better. 

Trained using spaCy-v3 and can be used directly as a package.
