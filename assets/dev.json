    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

The mutual topology is unable to extract power from turbine 4 since the higher rotational velocity causes both a reduced CP (57% of the separate topology at 1800 s) and an increased core loss. The separate topology is able to extract power from turbine 4 until 2700 s due to the lower rotational velocity.",

    "Metal–organic framework (MOF) materials show promise for H2 storage and it is widely predicted by computational modelling that MOFs incorporating ultra-micropores are optimal for H2 binding due to enhanced overlapping potentials. We report the investigation using inelastic neutron scattering of the interaction of H2 in an ultra-microporous MOF material showing low H2 uptake capacity. The study has revealed that adsorbed H2 at 5 K has a liquid recoil motion along the channel with very little interaction with the MOF host, consistent with the observed low uptake. The low H2 uptake is not due to incomplete activation or decomposition as the desolvated MOF shows CO2 uptake with a measured pore volume close to that of the single crystal pore volume. This study represents a unique example of surprisingly low H2 uptake within a MOF material, and complements the wide range of studies on systems showing higher uptake capacities and binding interactions.",

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1. However, by combining the fMRI and sMRI classifiers, the two groups of subjects were separable with a diagonal line as shown in the figures.",

    "In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

    "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",

The behaviour of devices will depend on the band gap of the absorber material and potentially on the window layer, where this is present. It is apparent from Fig. 7 that there is only a small spectral dependence for c-Si and CIGS devices.

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1.

The horizontal wind speeds were averaged over 60 min to reduce variability. A strong correlation was found between the two datasets, although the lidar has a tendency to overestimate the wind speed by ≈0–0.5 m s−1 at speeds of less than 20 m s−1. At higher wind speeds there are few data, so it is not possible to draw a robust conclusion for these conditions. The error in the lidar-derived wind speeds varies with the stability of the atmosphere; from 0.36 m s−1 in stable conditions, to 1.05 m s−1 in unstable conditions, and 0.86 m s−1 in neutral conditions.",

    "Fig. 4 shows the AFM images and corresponding 3D profiles of SiC wafer, CDC layer and dual-layer film, indicating surface morphology evolution in the process. The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The size of carbon particles is up to approximately 3 μm in diameter, and the surface roughness is substantially increased to 54.68 nm in RMS.",

Since the CVD carbon nucleates and grows on the top of CDC layer, top layer may copy the structure of CDC layer in some extent and therefore their Raman feature is similar. The up-shifted D-band of CVD layer may be attributed to the increased size of the graphite microcrystalline. It is also necessary to note that the densification of the CVD layer and the reduced internal stress may lead to the difference in Raman spectrum. The Raman spectrum of the CVD layer was also fitted with 2 + 2 Gaussian mode. The integrated intensity ratio (ID/IG) reduces to 1.32, corresponding to an increased La of 3.75 nm compared to CDC layer.",

The signatures of unaccelerated electron precipitation from electron spikes make up ∼70% of this total, occurring on 29.8% of MEX orbits, and are therefore the most common form of electron precipitation signature at Mars. This compares to signatures of accelerated electron precipitation from peaked electrons and “inverted-V” electrons, which occur on 9.8 and 3.4% of MEX orbits, respectively.

In a porous soil, the gradients in CO2 concentration and 13CO2 abundance adjust very quickly across depth. Thus, the soil CO2 and δ13C profiles reflect the depth-integrated CO2 sources (biotic processes) rather than the local fluctuations in production rates due to transient changes in CO2 diffusivity (abiotic processes) (Maseyk et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of partitioning soil efflux considering both the 13C discrimination of respiratory components and their mass-specific rate of CO2 production.",

    "K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman α line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010).

    "Metal–organic framework (MOF) complexes are a sub-class of porous solids which show great promise for gas storage and separation due to their high surface area, low framework density, and tuneable functional pore environment [3]. MOF materials are usually built up from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers to afford 3D extended frameworks with the formation of cavities ranging from microporous to mesoporous region. Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77 K) [4] with a record of ∼16 wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6]. However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material. There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use. In situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at below 10 K has been used previously to determine the locations of D2 within a few best-behaving MOF materials incorporating exposed metal sites [7–12]. It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state. These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities. Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study. Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.",

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "The modeled low shale barrier threshold pressures are potentially indicative of fracturing. However, the current pressure regime is extremely unlikely to cause fracturing, and so it is inferred that the shales may have been pervasively fractured in the past. A fracturing process consistent with the geological history of the region is that the shale barriers have undergone a transient pulse of fluid overpressure sufficient to fracture the rock. Such a pressure history could be a consequence of the rapid unloading of hundreds of meters of ice from the overburden during a deglaciation. A transient ice sheet load equivalent to 10 MPa of overpressure could have been removed rapidly by melting, or instantly by a sea level rise and the flotation of an ice sheet grounded on the seabed, during a typical ablation timespan of less than a few thousand years. At the shallow burial depth of these shales, 10 MPa is sufficient to exceed the tensional rock strength and cause pervasive hydraulic fracturing. This may have happened as a consequence of one or more regional ice sheet excursions into the basin. While the strength and thickness of the overburden at any given ice collapse is unknown, a conservative approximation for the fracture gradient, based on present-day leak-off tests (Nicoll, 2012), suggests that such an event is plausible.",

    "Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a now large number of studies show smaller 100 ms auditory amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) than healthy controls (HC). In a review of studies examining N1 and M100 in schizophrenia, Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that 100 ms auditory abnormalities are most commonly observed in studies using interstimulus intervals greater than 1 s and that an increase in N1 amplitude by allocation of attention is often lacking in individuals with SZ. Several large-sample studies provide examples. Examining N1 activity in the standard paired-click paradigm, Turetsky et al. (2008) observed a small first and a normal second N1 click response in SZ (N = 142) relative to HC (N = 221). Reduced N1 was also observed in the unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ without co-morbid psychiatric or substance use conditions, and N1 amplitude was observed to be a heritable measure and a better endophenotype than N1 gating. In another recent large-N study, Smith et al. (2010) used simultaneous EEG and MEG to examine 100 ms auditory processes in individuals with SZ (N = 79) and HC (N = 73) during a paired-click task. Patients had larger N1 Cz and left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) M100 ratio scores (second-click/first-click), with EEG and MEG ratio score group differences due to a smaller first click (S1) response in patients, suggesting a deficit in encoding auditory information rather than a deficit in filtering redundant information.",

In total, ASPERA-3 observes electron precipitation signatures on 43.0% of MEX orbits at Mars. The signatures of unaccelerated electron precipitation from electron spikes make up ∼70% of this total, occurring on 29.8% of MEX orbits, and are therefore the most common form of electron precipitation signature at Mars. This compares to signatures of accelerated electron precipitation from peaked electrons and “inverted-V” electrons, which occur on 9.8 and 3.4% of MEX orbits, respectively. This suggests a similarity to the Earth where the diffuse aurora from the precipitation of unaccelerated electrons accounts for a much larger amount of the precipitating flux of particles onto the atmosphere than discrete aurora (Newell et al., 2009).",

Our findings over a large corpus of C code was that 89% of the programs studied contained at least one dependence cluster composed of 10% or more of the program's statements.

    "In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

    "K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman α line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010). Hence the mean temperature in the thermosphere of HD209458b is approximately 8250 K (the M7 model of K10).",

For a moderate field strength of 80 mV m−1 the temperature is virtually constant when increasing the energy flux from 0.2 to 1.2 mW m−2, while at E = 100 mV m−1 it increases from ∼550 K to 850 K. Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).",

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

    "The modeled low shale barrier threshold pressures are potentially indicative of fracturing. However, the current pressure regime is extremely unlikely to cause fracturing, and so it is inferred that the shales may have been pervasively fractured in the past. A fracturing process consistent with the geological history of the region is that the shale barriers have undergone a transient pulse of fluid overpressure sufficient to fracture the rock. Such a pressure history could be a consequence of the rapid unloading of hundreds of meters of ice from the overburden during a deglaciation. A transient ice sheet load equivalent to 10 MPa of overpressure could have been removed rapidly by melting, or instantly by a sea level rise and the flotation of an ice sheet grounded on the seabed, during a typical ablation timespan of less than a few thousand years. At the shallow burial depth of these shales, 10 MPa is sufficient to exceed the tensional rock strength and cause pervasive hydraulic fracturing. This may have happened as a consequence of one or more regional ice sheet excursions into the basin. While the strength and thickness of the overburden at any given ice collapse is unknown, a conservative approximation for the fracture gradient, based on present-day leak-off tests (Nicoll, 2012), suggests that such an event is plausible.",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",

    "Epoxy polymers are a class of high-performance thermosetting polymers which are widely used for the matrices of fibre-reinforced composite materials and as adhesives. They are known for their excellent engineering properties, such as high modulus, low creep, high strength, and good thermal and dimensional stabilities. However, epoxy polymers have inherently low toughness and impact resistance due to their highly crosslinked structure. This structure leads to brittle behaviour and causes the polymers to suffer from relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. To improve the toughness of epoxy polymers, it has been established that the incorporation of a second micro-phase of a dispersed rubber, e.g. Refs. [1–5], or a thermoplastic polymer, e.g. Ref. [6–8], can increase the toughness. Here the rubber or thermoplastic particles are typically about 0.1–5 μm in diameter with a volume fraction of about 5–20%. The particles are typically well-dispersed, and formed by reaction-induced phase-separation. However, the particle size is difficult to control as it is dependent on the curing conditions, and hence cannot be varied systematically without changing the properties of the epoxy polymer.",

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1.

    "Using the optimized operating conditions we demonstrate serial passaging and expansion of two integration-free hiPSC lines in completely defined xeno-free media in 100-ml bioreactors. The cells exhibited homogeneous aggregate formation, steady expansion in their pluripotent state, and normal karyotype after ~ 20 passages. Note that one experiment of extended expansion of TNC1 cells in spinner flask (p30 + 6 + 21) showed abnormal karyotype (47, XXY). However, there is no evidence that it should be attributed to the suspension culture. In general, recently improved iPSC culture conditions reduce selective pressure for the growth of mutated cells that acquire growth advantages. Although karyotypically abnormal cells were found occasionally after long-term cultures under both adherent and suspension conditions, the frequency is low (5% of tested batches of hiPSCs and hESCs). The standard karyotyping or other genotyping methods like what we performed here will remain necessary to manage this inherent issue of long-term cell cultures.",

Thus the temporal sense of a crossing associated with a normal (inbound/outbound) and the tilt of the measured normal with respect to the model normal (sunward/antisunward) tells us if the assumed waves were propagating sunward or tailward. Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 9 show the results of this exercise. 77% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 77% of the dawn side crossings and 76% of the dusk side crossings. Considering that not all of the crossings were necessarily crossings of a boundary perturbed by surface waves, these results support predominantly tailward wave propagation. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show the inferred propagation directions for the crossings associated with waves only. In this case, 89% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 94% of the dawn side crossings and 86% of the dusk side crossings.

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2.

A coincident reduction in I. hiatus swamp conifers indicates possible disturbance of nearby coastal environments possibly from flooding (see Section 4.5). An associated reduction in δ13C may have been caused by stratification of the North Sea from an enhanced halocline, trapping 12C-enriched organic carbon at depth.

    "Lithology in the CTBI includes interbedded shales, clays and mudstones, some of which are pyritiferous. The organic matter in the black shales is of marine origin, but includes a significant fraction of terrigenous material (Forster et al., 2008). The black shales are highly laminated and relatively undisturbed by bioturbation. The δ13Corg record is incomplete due to poor core recovery and low sample yield, but an excursion signifying OAE 2 is recorded: a 0.5‰ VPDB negative shift immediately precedes the 4‰ positive excursion, −27.7 to −23.7‰ (Fig. 2; Supplementary Material, Table 1f; Forster et al., 2008). The characteristic excursion spans ∼2 m of finely interbedded shales and mudstones. Throughout OAE 2, the δ13Corg values fluctuate between ∼−23.5‰ to −27.5‰.

    "Sites were surveyed using 2 × 2 m temporary quadrats placed along equally spaced line transects. The separation S (in m) between transects and between quadrats on transects was computed by the formula (Harmer and Morgan, 2009): S=100A/n, where A is the site area (ha) and n the number of quadrats (detailed in Table 1). Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

    "K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman α line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010). Hence the mean temperature in the thermosphere of HD209458b is approximately 8250 K (the M7 model of K10).",

    "The temperature changes with electron energy flux depend on the electric field strength that was set. For a moderate field strength of 80 mV m−1 the temperature is virtually constant when increasing the energy flux from 0.2 to 1.2 mW m−2, while at E = 100 mV m−1 it increases from ∼550 K to 850 K. Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).",

    "Flybys E12 and E13 (middle and right panels of Fig. 2) were nearly identical in terms of the flyby geometry, directly above the north pole of the moon with a minimum distance of only 50 km. Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region. This may be coincidence and has to be checked during the upcoming encounters for consistency.",

    "As noted in the Introduction, Naatanen and Picton (1987) argued that the electric N1 reflects contributions from frontal sources as well as from primary auditory cortex. Present results provide confirmation of these findings, with frontal activity observed in both groups (Fig. 2). Findings are also consistent with imaging studies that have observed frontal activity during auditory tasks.22Although many paired-click studies have examined the association between frontal activity and gating measures (e.g., second click divided by first click), studies examining associations between paired-click ratio scores and frontal activity but not also associations between first click activity and frontal activity are not discussed as findings between ratio scores and frontal activity are outside the scope of this study (e.g., EEG studies such as Williams et al. (2011) and fMRI studies such as Tregellas et al. (2007) and Mayer et al. (2009)). For example, examining auditory responses in patients with epilepsy using intracranial microelectrode grids, Korzyukov et al. (2007) detected 50 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity, findings consistent with earlier corticography studies suggesting frontal contributions to P50 (Grunwald et al., 2003). Boutros et al. (2011) also detected 100 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity using subdural electrodes. Similar to present findings in controls, Boutros et al. observed activity in the posterior part of STG and in left ventral prefrontal cortex (more exact comparisons between the two studies in terms of frontal activity are difficult, as many subjects in Boutros et al. did not have electrodes placed in anterior frontal regions). Boutros et al. (2011) also observed 100 ms auditory activity in middle temporal gyrus, parietal, cingulate, and occipital regions. Activity observed in similar but not identical locations in these other areas in the present study may be due to the significant latency variability Boutros et al. (2011) observed in several regions. Variability across subjects in the location of activation may also account for study differences.",

The bottom left half of the figure (below the thick red line) represents a range of observed temperatures on Saturn (400–650 K) and thus of “allowed” combinations of electric field strength and particle flux. In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values.

Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

    "MRPL12 is the orthologue of eubacterial L7/L12, where L7 is identical to L12 except that it is N-terminal acetylated. L7/L12 is also phosphorylated, which can affect both conformation and binding to partner ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Ref. [37]). This modification has now been confirmed to be present in mammalian MRPL12 [59]. In eubacteria, association of L7/12 to the large subunit takes place via the L10 protein such that two L7/L12 heterodimers normally associate per LSU [60]. Interestingly these dimers are actively exchanged on the 70S molecule without disruption of the ribosomal particle [54,61]. The dimerization status and number of dimers attached to the human 55S has not been clarified. In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate demonstrated similar levels small subunit polypeptides including DAP3 and MRPS18B in subject and control samples. In contrast, the total amount of MRPL12 was reduced (Fig. 7B). In the patient the IP is restricted to MRPL12 in the large subunit or the fully assembled 55S with the total amount of MRPL12 being reduced as it lacks the “free” population. The densitometric measurements indicate that the patient IP has ~ 49% MRPL12 compared to control, in accordance with the gradient and steady state data. ICT1 appears to be sensitive to the MRPL12 levels and so is reduced in both the IP (~ 58% of control) and in the steady state westerns (Fig. 4). The lower levels of MRPL12 could reflect loss of multimerization but since the region in the bacterial protein involved in multimerization is towards the N-terminus [62], this mutation is unlikely to have an impact on dimer/multimer formation. The translation factor bound dimer has been suggested to have an increased affinity for the ribosome [54,61]. Thus a possible explanation is that the mutation affects translation factor binding, thereby reducing the affinity of the mutant MRPL12 for the ribosome. If this were the case, however, then we would expect an increase in the pool of free MRPL12 whereas the subject exhibits a reduced pool of free MRPL12, which interacts with POLRMT [57]. The immunoprecipitation was performed using an MRPL12 specific antibody and so should contain all free MRPL12, MRPL12 associated with uncomplexed mt-LSU and MRPL12 as part of the fully assembled 55S. Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components. Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.",

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "Human MRPL12 is 27.5% identical in amino acid sequence to the previously crystallized T. maritima L12 ribosomal protein. The C-terminal domain (CTD) (107 to end in Escherichia coli) is conserved in evolution [50] and is required for initial binding and GTPase activation for both EF-Tu and EF-G. Indeed, both EF-Tu and EF-G have greatly diminished GTPase activity on ribosomes lacking the CTD of L12 [51,52]. Superimposition of MRPL12 with the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome (PDB code: 2WRL) lacking L7/L12 stalk proteins shows that MRPL12 Ala181 is located within this highly conserved region (Fig. 3A). Moreover, modeling of MRPL12 shows Ala181 positioned in a helix potentially involved in translation factor interactions (Fig. 3A/B). Bacterial L7/L12 CTDs also contain a number of strictly conserved residues that are involved in the initial contact with elongation factors [52,53] and crucial for translation [54]. Alanine is one of the best helix forming residues and substitutions can therefore have profound energetic effects by perturbing packing interactions or tertiary contacts [55]. Thus, the p.Ala181Val change might be predicted to alter interactions with the elongation factors, and since MRPL7/12 bound to elongation factors is predicted to have a higher affinity for the ribosome [54], the mutation may in turn affect both rate and accuracy of mitochondrial translation.",

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1. However, by combining the fMRI and sMRI classifiers, the two groups of subjects were separable with a diagonal line as shown in the figures.",

Over-expression of the endogenous ortholog of this gene in P. trichocarpa resulted in starch accumulation in stem and roots, and, consequently, significantly more stem and root biomass [110]. Many of the transgenic plants had malformed root systems that may have contributed to a 50% mortality rate in the greenhouse. Subsequently, the survivors were able to develop normal root systems.

    "Although computer-aided diagnosis of hearing loss is not needed, our algorithm can potentially advance the study of congenital hearing loss mechanism by identifying discriminative brain regions as disease biomarkers for hearing impairment at various levels in the auditory system. Inspecting the most important features that differentiate children born with hearing impairment from children with normal hearing in this study, we see some features that are in line with hypotheses about under stimulation of auditory function in HI infants; while other observations already begin to add to our knowledge of how congenital deafness affects brain development and function. For example, features B, F, H, and I include known components of the auditory language network which our group and others have previously shown to be engaged by the narrative comprehension task (Karunanayaka et al., 2007; Schmithorst et al., 2006). These features include (B) the planum temporale and primary auditory cortex in the left hemisphere (including Wernicke's area, the classical language recognition module), as well as the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus at the temporal parietal junction of the (F) left and (H, I) right hemispheres, known auditory and visual language association regions. Although all participants were bilaterally severely to profoundly hearing impaired, we observe left dominant auditory/language related activity present in components A, B, and F. In addition, components H and I contain right hemisphere auditory/language activity. Functional features such as these are not unexpected in terms of regions of differential cortical activation between HI and NH children listening to natural language as an auditory stimulus and it is reassuring to see these regions highlighted by our algorithm as potential biomarkers corresponding to hearing impairment. Similarly, there is evidence of differential activation in subcortical features corresponding to the auditory brainstem pathways. Features A, D, and J include elements of the reticular auditory pathway of the brainstem which has been identified by electrophysiological studies to have a key role in auditory perception of location of sounds as well as the ability to filter a source of sound in background noise. Roughly these features appear to encompass key elements of the auditory pathway at the level of the pons (D) including the cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body, lateral lemniscus and superior olive on the right, (A) inferior colliculus, medial geniculate on the left and (J) thalamus bilaterally (Kretschmann and Weinrich, 1998). Although the resolution of the fMRI scans (4 × 4 × 5 mm) is not sufficient to resolve these structures individually, differences in activation in these regions, as indicated by reference to the higher resolution anatomical images, suggest that brain stem auditory nuclei may be involved.",

The time when pressure first changes (i.e. the arrival of the pressure front) is well-predicted across the swash zone, as are the magnitudes of pressure head during uprush and backwash. The numerical model captures well the groundwater response to surface–subsurface water exchange, with reasonable agreement between the model-predicted and measured exit point during the backwash. Discrepancies between model and experimental results are primarily due to the relatively simple parametrisation of the bed shear stress for the surface flow and the approximation of the subsurface flow as (coupled) one-dimensional processes.",

A strong correlation was found between the two datasets, although the lidar has a tendency to overestimate the wind speed by ≈0–0.5 m s−1 at speeds of less than 20 m s−1. At higher wind speeds there are few data, so it is not possible to draw a robust conclusion for these conditions.

    "Great care was taken to avoid contamination of the samples by metallic impurities during the oxygen precipitation process. However, some samples were intentionally subsequently contaminated with iron, using the same procedure as in Refs. [23,34,35]. This involved rubbing the back-side of the sample with iron pieces (99.95% purity from Testbourne Limited, UK). Samples were then annealed in air in a pre-heated furnace at temperatures up to 798 °C for times chosen to ensure complete iron diffusion through the sample. Although our intention was to contaminate samples only with iron, the possibility that other transition metal impurities have entered the samples cannot be completely ruled out. Cooling was rapid, with the samples removed from the furnace at temperature and placed on a heat sink. It is estimated that samples were cooled to below ∼100 °C in <10 s. Samples which were not intentionally contaminated with iron are referred to as “uncontaminated” samples in this paper, although it is possible that the low levels of impurity contamination in such samples have significant effects, as discussed later.",

Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively.

Thus the temporal sense of a crossing associated with a normal (inbound/outbound) and the tilt of the measured normal with respect to the model normal (sunward/antisunward) tells us if the assumed waves were propagating sunward or tailward. Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 9 show the results of this exercise. 77% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 77% of the dawn side crossings and 76% of the dusk side crossings. Considering that not all of the crossings were necessarily crossings of a boundary perturbed by surface waves, these results support predominantly tailward wave propagation. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show the inferred propagation directions for the crossings associated with waves only. In this case, 89% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 94% of the dawn side crossings and 86% of the dusk side crossings.

    "The purpose of the sensitivity tests was not to model a physically plausible environment on Mars; however, the tests revealed that no one factor could perturb the nominal model to produce amounts of perchlorate that approach the amount measured by the Phoenix Lander. A combination of such factors, including reduced odd nitrogen fluxes, higher oxygen mixing ratios, and increased temperatures may have worked in concert to produce larger perchlorate:nitrate ratios. Specifically, if odd nitrogen downward fluxes and oxygen escape rates are smaller than currently thought, nitrate fluxes would drop while perchlorate fluxes would increase. In conjunction, as the surface temperature warms toward 280 K (as it does in the current equatorial summer) local perchlorate production fluxes could increase further. While it is possible to tweak the photochemical model into this mode, it is difficult to imagine a self-consistent scenario where all of these processes are working in concert to create high perchlorate:nitrate and perchlorate:chloride ratios on Mars, so we favor an additional source for perchlorate.",

Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010).

    "By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery. Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6 ± 0.2% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5% when new to 21% at age 19. This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms. This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9%.",

    "Salts are relevant to the habitability of Mars. First, perchlorate reduction is a metabolism used by some terrestrial bacteria in anaerobic conditions (Coates and Achenbach, 2004). If such organisms exist (or did exist) on Mars, then they could gain energy by reducing perchlorate and oxidizing an electron donor such as organic carbon or ferrous iron. This would require organic molecules to be present on Mars. Indigenous organic molecules have yet to be confirmed on Mars; however the presence of perchlorate itself may have inhibited the detection of organics on Mars in pyrolysis experiments (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010). Second, perchlorate salts are highly deliquescent and significantly lower the freezing point of liquid water (Gough et al., 2011). The eutectic point of Mg(ClO4)2 is −57 °C (Stillman and Grimm, 2011), while that of Ca(ClO4)2 is −75 °C (Pestova et al., 2005). Given typical soil salt concentrations, small amounts of water (∼0.02 g H2O per g soil) would permit a water activity sufficient for terrestrial life to be viable (Kounaves et al., 2010b). Third, if all organisms require fixed nitrogen in proteins and nucleic acids, as they do on Earth, then the discovery of nitrogen oxyanions on Mars would be significant as well.",

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1. However, by combining the fMRI and sMRI classifiers, the two groups of subjects were separable with a diagonal line as shown in the figures.",

    "The XPS analysis also reveals low calcium phosphate levels in the PLGA–HA samples, despite the fact that the fibres are filled with a large amount of nanoparticles. Since XPS is a surface chemical analysis technique (with analysis depth less than 10 nm), this suggests that the nanoparticles lying at the surface of the fibres were embedded in a thin layer of polymer. The presence of carbon observed by XPS at the surface of the HA nanoparticles might result from atmospheric contamination by CO2 and volatile fatty acids. At the surface of the CaP fibres, an additional reason for the presence of carbon might be the existence of residual atoms from the degradation–evaporation of the PLGA polymer. This would explain the higher proportion of carbon when compared to the native HA nanopowder and why the ratio of oxygen to carbon is lower. The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature. For pure HA, this reaction is known to occur at sintering temperatures below 1200 °C with a conversion degree of 0.4 to 0.5 [25]. A simple way to present the reaction formula for dehydroxylation would beCa10(PO4)6(OH)2→Ca10(PO4)6O+H2O",

    "The cumulative lifetime output of a 100 MW wind farm with a 28.5% load factor would be 4.99 TWh over 20 years. If this farm suffers a linear annual deterioration of −0.41 points after the first year, its lifetime output reduces to 4.37 TWh, a fall of 12.5%. This will increase the cost of electricity from wind generators, as less electricity is produced to recover the costs of construction. The economic value of the lost output is relatively low as it mostly occurs in the far future.

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

    "Epoxy polymers are a class of high-performance thermosetting polymers which are widely used for the matrices of fibre-reinforced composite materials and as adhesives. They are known for their excellent engineering properties, such as high modulus, low creep, high strength, and good thermal and dimensional stabilities. However, epoxy polymers have inherently low toughness and impact resistance due to their highly crosslinked structure. This structure leads to brittle behaviour and causes the polymers to suffer from relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. To improve the toughness of epoxy polymers, it has been established that the incorporation of a second micro-phase of a dispersed rubber, e.g. Refs. [1–5], or a thermoplastic polymer, e.g. Ref. [6–8], can increase the toughness. Here the rubber or thermoplastic particles are typically about 0.1–5 μm in diameter with a volume fraction of about 5–20%. The particles are typically well-dispersed, and formed by reaction-induced phase-separation. However, the particle size is difficult to control as it is dependent on the curing conditions, and hence cannot be varied systematically without changing the properties of the epoxy polymer.",

The up-shifted D-band of CVD layer may be attributed to the increased size of the graphite microcrystalline. It is also necessary to note that the densification of the CVD layer and the reduced internal stress may lead to the difference in Raman spectrum.

However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012).

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.",

    "Due to the genetic load of the pearl millet landraces used (which were never self-pollinated before), the comparatively poorer seedling establishment of the S1 materials turned out to be a disadvantage in the S1 selection process, leading to higher experimental errors (lower heritabilities) in the S1 in the C0, C2 and C4 trials, especially for ASNPC and DM (Table 1). In the C0 evaluation, S1 progenies flowered three weeks later than the FS. This was due to poorer S1 plant establishment after a severe drought that occurred after planting. Relatively high panicle yield (484 g m−2) was recorded in C3 in the FS, which was due to the favorable 2009 rainy season conditions. Since both S1 and FS progenies were evaluated in separate field trials, and since both S1 and FS selection schemes were combined, a real comparison of means and selection efficiencies is not possible in this study.",

    "Melin et al. (2006) analysed infrared data from an auroral heating event observed by Stallard et al. (2001, 2002) (from September 8 to 11, 1998) and found that particle precipitation could not account for the observed increase in ionospheric temperature (940–1065 K). The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).",

    "Fig. 4 shows the AFM images and corresponding 3D profiles of SiC wafer, CDC layer and dual-layer film, indicating surface morphology evolution in the process. The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The size of carbon particles is up to approximately 3 μm in diameter, and the surface roughness is substantially increased to 54.68 nm in RMS.",

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

Since the CVD carbon nucleates and grows on the top of CDC layer, top layer may copy the structure of CDC layer in some extent and therefore their Raman feature is similar. The up-shifted D-band of CVD layer may be attributed to the increased size of the graphite microcrystalline. It is also necessary to note that the densification of the CVD layer and the reduced internal stress may lead to the difference in Raman spectrum.

Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature.

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa.

Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance.

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

The horizontal wind speeds were averaged over 60 min to reduce variability. A strong correlation was found between the two datasets, although the lidar has a tendency to overestimate the wind speed by ≈0–0.5 m s−1 at speeds of less than 20 m s−1. At higher wind speeds there are few data, so it is not possible to draw a robust conclusion for these conditions. The error in the lidar-derived wind speeds varies with the stability of the atmosphere; from 0.36 m s−1 in stable conditions, to 1.05 m s−1 in unstable conditions, and 0.86 m s−1 in neutral conditions.",

    "In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

    "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.",

At the early stages of swash, however, there is a disagreement: the experimental results show an approximately constant gradient whereas the simulation results suggest a steep increase upon the bore arrival, followed by a gradual decline. At the initial stages of infiltration, when the height of surface water is much greater than the penetration depth, hydraulic gradients are expected to be higher than later on. Furthermore, when the penetration depth is small the experimental error in evaluating gradients is large. For these reasons the discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is probably due to experimental error.",

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",

    "A further finding from the upper panel of Fig. 12 relates to possible restrictions on combinations of electric field strength and 10 keV electron energy flux. The bottom left half of the figure (below the thick red line) represents a range of observed temperatures on Saturn (400–650 K) and thus of “allowed” combinations of electric field strength and particle flux. In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values. This combination of values cannot thus occur for extended periods on Saturn.",

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "Melin et al. (2006) analysed infrared data from an auroral heating event observed by Stallard et al. (2001, 2002) (from September 8 to 11, 1998) and found that particle precipitation could not account for the observed increase in ionospheric temperature (940–1065 K). The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).",

    "The temperature changes with electron energy flux depend on the electric field strength that was set. For a moderate field strength of 80 mV m−1 the temperature is virtually constant when increasing the energy flux from 0.2 to 1.2 mW m−2, while at E = 100 mV m−1 it increases from ∼550 K to 850 K. Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).",

    "Salts are relevant to the habitability of Mars. First, perchlorate reduction is a metabolism used by some terrestrial bacteria in anaerobic conditions (Coates and Achenbach, 2004). If such organisms exist (or did exist) on Mars, then they could gain energy by reducing perchlorate and oxidizing an electron donor such as organic carbon or ferrous iron. This would require organic molecules to be present on Mars. Indigenous organic molecules have yet to be confirmed on Mars; however the presence of perchlorate itself may have inhibited the detection of organics on Mars in pyrolysis experiments (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010). Second, perchlorate salts are highly deliquescent and significantly lower the freezing point of liquid water (Gough et al., 2011). The eutectic point of Mg(ClO4)2 is −57 °C (Stillman and Grimm, 2011), while that of Ca(ClO4)2 is −75 °C (Pestova et al., 2005). Given typical soil salt concentrations, small amounts of water (∼0.02 g H2O per g soil) would permit a water activity sufficient for terrestrial life to be viable (Kounaves et al., 2010b). Third, if all organisms require fixed nitrogen in proteins and nucleic acids, as they do on Earth, then the discovery of nitrogen oxyanions on Mars would be significant as well.",

STC represent rather favourable operating conditions for most PV technologies as it is an unrealistic combination of a cold module temperature (25 °C) at a high irradiance (1000 W/m2). Different modules, even of the same technology, generally have different rated powers and the energy yields must be made comparable in any inter-comparison study. This is achieved by using the specific yield (kWh/kWp).

    "Table 1 presents the percentage of MEX orbits that we observe the different combinations of energy distribution asymmetries. In total, ASPERA-3 observes electron precipitation signatures on 43.0% of MEX orbits at Mars. The signatures of unaccelerated electron precipitation from electron spikes make up ∼70% of this total, occurring on 29.8% of MEX orbits, and are therefore the most common form of electron precipitation signature at Mars. This compares to signatures of accelerated electron precipitation from peaked electrons and “inverted-V” electrons, which occur on 9.8 and 3.4% of MEX orbits, respectively. This suggests a similarity to the Earth where the diffuse aurora from the precipitation of unaccelerated electrons accounts for a much larger amount of the precipitating flux of particles onto the atmosphere than discrete aurora (Newell et al., 2009).",

Flow cytometry using antibodies against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C revealed that mature neurons on days 35 and 71 expressed only a low level of MHC-I, and that the expression was enhanced in response to interferon gamma (IFN-γ: 25 ng/ml for 48 hr; Figure 2A). The expression level of the mRNAs was approximately 1:100 compared with peripheral blood cells in both fibroblast- and blood-cell-derived iPSCs, which was again increased by exposure to IFN-γ (Figure 2B).

The bottom left half of the figure (below the thick red line) represents a range of observed temperatures on Saturn (400–650 K) and thus of “allowed” combinations of electric field strength and particle flux. In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values.

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

If this farm suffers a linear annual deterioration of −0.41 points after the first year, its lifetime output reduces to 4.37 TWh, a fall of 12.5%. This will increase the cost of electricity from wind generators, as less electricity is produced to recover the costs of construction.

    "MRPL12 is the orthologue of eubacterial L7/L12, where L7 is identical to L12 except that it is N-terminal acetylated. L7/L12 is also phosphorylated, which can affect both conformation and binding to partner ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Ref. [37]). This modification has now been confirmed to be present in mammalian MRPL12 [59]. In eubacteria, association of L7/12 to the large subunit takes place via the L10 protein such that two L7/L12 heterodimers normally associate per LSU [60]. Interestingly these dimers are actively exchanged on the 70S molecule without disruption of the ribosomal particle [54,61]. The dimerization status and number of dimers attached to the human 55S has not been clarified. In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate demonstrated similar levels small subunit polypeptides including DAP3 and MRPS18B in subject and control samples. In contrast, the total amount of MRPL12 was reduced (Fig. 7B). In the patient the IP is restricted to MRPL12 in the large subunit or the fully assembled 55S with the total amount of MRPL12 being reduced as it lacks the “free” population. The densitometric measurements indicate that the patient IP has ~ 49% MRPL12 compared to control, in accordance with the gradient and steady state data. ICT1 appears to be sensitive to the MRPL12 levels and so is reduced in both the IP (~ 58% of control) and in the steady state westerns (Fig. 4). The lower levels of MRPL12 could reflect loss of multimerization but since the region in the bacterial protein involved in multimerization is towards the N-terminus [62], this mutation is unlikely to have an impact on dimer/multimer formation. The translation factor bound dimer has been suggested to have an increased affinity for the ribosome [54,61]. Thus a possible explanation is that the mutation affects translation factor binding, thereby reducing the affinity of the mutant MRPL12 for the ribosome. If this were the case, however, then we would expect an increase in the pool of free MRPL12 whereas the subject exhibits a reduced pool of free MRPL12, which interacts with POLRMT [57]. The immunoprecipitation was performed using an MRPL12 specific antibody and so should contain all free MRPL12, MRPL12 associated with uncomplexed mt-LSU and MRPL12 as part of the fully assembled 55S. Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components. Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.",

(2005), and (ii) a system where the thermosphere responds on the order of 2 days and, as such, is essentially unresponsive to transient events (Gong, 2005).

    "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.",

The difference between the transit depths based on the empirical and hydrodynamic models arises because the C2 model has large temperature gradients (Paper I) and a gradual H/H+ transition rather than a sharp cutoff. The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown).

    "SEM–EDS analysis of sorbent sampled from the carbonator after each test was undertaken to determine the percentage weight of the elemental species present. The results as shown in Fig. 8 confirm that increasing bed inventory generally increases the presence of Al, Fe and Cu. Al was identified in the unreacted sample at a weight% of 0.34, but this increased to similar values of 0.67% and 0.66% for 4.5 kg and 6 kg samples respectively, with a much higher value of 3.98% for 13 kg sample of sorbent. This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions.

The numerical predictions of the pore-air pressure build-up within the two sediments are in good agreement with the large-scale laboratory measurements. The time when pressure first changes (i.e. the arrival of the pressure front) is well-predicted across the swash zone, as are the magnitudes of pressure head during uprush and backwash. The numerical model captures well the groundwater response to surface–subsurface water exchange, with reasonable agreement between the model-predicted and measured exit point during the backwash.

However, some samples were intentionally subsequently contaminated with iron, using the same procedure as in Refs. [23,34,35]. This involved rubbing the back-side of the sample with iron pieces (99.95% purity from Testbourne Limited, UK). Samples were then annealed in air in a pre-heated furnace at temperatures up to 798 °C for times chosen to ensure complete iron diffusion through the sample. Although our intention was to contaminate samples only with iron, the possibility that other transition metal impurities have entered the samples cannot be completely ruled out. Cooling was rapid, with the samples removed from the furnace at temperature and placed on a heat sink. It is estimated that samples were cooled to below ∼100 °C in <10 s. Samples which were not intentionally contaminated with iron are referred to as “uncontaminated” samples in this paper, although it is possible that the low levels of impurity contamination in such samples have significant effects, as discussed later.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2. A fitted profile plot for the PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 1.

    "SEM–EDS analysis of sorbent sampled from the carbonator after each test was undertaken to determine the percentage weight of the elemental species present. The results as shown in Fig. 8 confirm that increasing bed inventory generally increases the presence of Al, Fe and Cu. Al was identified in the unreacted sample at a weight% of 0.34, but this increased to similar values of 0.67% and 0.66% for 4.5 kg and 6 kg samples respectively, with a much higher value of 3.98% for 13 kg sample of sorbent. This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions. Although the values are small, a steady decrease in Si weight% was recorded with increasing sorbent mass, implying removal of Si from limestone in the capture process. However the lowest value was recorded for the unreacted limestone.",

A coincident reduction in I. hiatus swamp conifers indicates possible disturbance of nearby coastal environments possibly from flooding (see Section 4.5). An associated reduction in δ13C may have been caused by stratification of the North Sea from an enhanced halocline, trapping 12C-enriched organic carbon at depth.

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "Fig. 18 presents typical bed shear stress time-series estimated from the velocity measurements via the momentum balance, log-law and Reynolds stress methods. The example results shown are for x = 0.772 m on the 1.3 mm sand-rough and 5.4 mm gravel-rough beaches. The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method. Another benefit of the log-law method is that it has been extensively used in the literature, making comparison of our results with previous results more straightforward.",

    "The Venusian ionosphere exhibited a number of asymmetries between the dawn and dusk sectors. Brace et al. (1982) observed that the ionopause was higher on the dawn side than at dusk due to interaction with the solar wind. Miller and Knudsen (1987) reported larger antisunward velocities within the ionosphere on the dawn side than on the dusk side above an altitude of 400 km, with the pattern reversed below this altitude. The dawn–dusk asymmetry below 400 km was largely attributed to photoionisation as plasma in the post-noon sector had been exposed to sunlight for longer than plasma in the pre-noon sector. The plasma flow from the dayside to the nightside was driven by the day-to-night pressure gradient, with the higher plasma densities in the post-noon sector enhancing the nightward transport of ions on the dusk side. The super-rotation of the neutral atmosphere also enhanced the ion flow on the dusk side and reduced the flow on the dawn side due to collisional interactions between the ions and the neutral species. A subsequent modelling study at the altitude of the peak density in the ionosphere (∼140 km) showed that differences in the thermospheric composition between the dawn and dusk sides may also cause asymmetries in the ionosphere at these altitudes due to changes in the dominant chemical reactions (Fox and Kasprzak, 2007).",

Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).",

These events contribute to the relatively high toughness measured from the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers. The differences observed at low temperatures indicate that the increase of the cavitational resistance of the S-CSR particles delays the cavitation process and enhances the localised shear-band yielding process. The increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer attenuates the deformation of the polymer and reduces the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip, but this effect is compensated for by the increased energy absorption from the enhanced shear-band yielding. Hence, there is a reduction of the toughening performance of the S-CSR particles at low temperatures, but the competition between these effects results in the fracture energy being independent of the test temperature between −55 °C and −109 °C.",

However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

    "On the necessity of field trialsFast growth in the GMO greenhouse does not always translate into superior growth in the field. Even with non-transgenic trees, breeders experience difficulty in predicting the mature tree phenotype from greenhouse stock (so called ‘age-age’ correlations). Multiple genetic factors, assembled by breeding into one genotype to contribute to a specific phenotype, may respond differently at different growth stages to various aspects of the field environment. At the earliest, the volume of 10-year-old Populus trees can be reasonably predicted only from the volumes of three-year-old saplings [221]. Other slower-growing species require data from much older (>10-year-old) trees to predict potential harvest indices at maturity.In more than two decades of transgenesis, the single-gene/single-trait approach of molecular biologists has successfully generated genetically modified organisms with relatively stable trait expression [222]. Transgene instability, while common during the early phases of selection and growth in vitro, tends to be relatively rare under field conditions [2]. Transgenic plants modified with single potent genes to produce novel traits like GUS [223], herbicide resistance [224], and even complex characters like superior growth [71], have all been shown to stably display the desired phenotypes in the field. The expression of the rolC transgene was stable in 19-year-old tissue cultures and 18-year-old glasshouse-grown trees [225]. Except for viral approaches like VIGS/VOX [219], reversion to wild type has been relatively rare and this is often detected quite early primarily because over-expression of key genes has such a remarkable effect on the transgenic phenotype.Nevertheless, it is always prudent to implement field trials of appropriate duration, especially when transgenics are involved. Transgenic poplar (P. alba) that overproduced XYLOGLUCANASE grew 40% taller than wild type in growth chambers but subsequently grew poorly in field trials [109]. In another example, incomplete barstar attenuation of the cytotoxicity of a poplar LEAFY promoter::barnase construct in transgenic hybrid poplar (P. tremula × alba) led to substantially reduced growth rates in the field, prompting the authors to highlight the importance of field testing to identify pleiotropic effects [127].Another justification for field testing is that genetic transformation methods that require regeneration from callus are prone to random somaclonal mutations during in vitro culture [226]. Unfortunately, the effects of somaclonal mutations may or may not be related to the target phenotype, and their effects on the phenotype may be stage- or tissue specific. Hence, even transgenics that express stable and potent genes, such as those that produce insecticidal proteins, need to be tested in field trials at multiple locations and for specific durations. Such comprehensive and long-term testing may expose those transgenic plants that have otherwise cryptic traits due to the mutation of non-target genes.In addition, lab assays need to be designed to be more predictive of performance in the field. For example, leaf-feeding assays in the lab indicated that hybrid aspen (P. tremula × alba) over-expressing a gene for POLYPHENOL OXIDASE produced leaves that were toxic to forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) [161] but this could not be replicated in a subsequent field trial [162]. Again, this result emphasizes the need to verify gene activity at various stages of the plant's cycle, from in-vitro cultivation to growth in the field.The genes featured in Fig. 1 have been tested and proven to generate the expected phenotypes in various independent experiments involving unrelated plant taxa. However, the effects of their simultaneous introduction into a plant genome are difficult to predict. The best gene combinations for biomass yield will only be revealed by the transgenic line(s) with the best growth under various test conditions. Hence, comprehensive and rigorous field testing, preferably in multiple sites, is imperative. In multi-trait engineering, it may be wise to reduce the stringency of selection prior to field planting and test as many of the transgenics as clones in experiments replicated in multiple plots over several locations and then monitored through time. Such field trials should be managed in accordance with standard commercial practices for each location. This intermediate stage may reveal, among others, the suitability of the transgenic plant for clonal propagation and allow the generation of sufficient planting material for multi-location testing. Serial selection of the most promising transgenic plants can be performed at various times thereafter. All trials need to be monitored for as long as practicable—in the face of current regulations that require prompt elimination of test materials just before they start flowering.",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",

If this farm suffers a linear annual deterioration of −0.41 points after the first year, its lifetime output reduces to 4.37 TWh, a fall of 12.5%. This will increase the cost of electricity from wind generators, as less electricity is produced to recover the costs of construction. The economic value of the lost output is relatively low as it mostly occurs in the far future. With a discount rate of 10%, degradation increases the levelised cost of electricity by 9%, from approximately £90 [4,5] to £98 per MWh.

    "The Venusian ionosphere exhibited a number of asymmetries between the dawn and dusk sectors. Brace et al. (1982) observed that the ionopause was higher on the dawn side than at dusk due to interaction with the solar wind. Miller and Knudsen (1987) reported larger antisunward velocities within the ionosphere on the dawn side than on the dusk side above an altitude of 400 km, with the pattern reversed below this altitude. The dawn–dusk asymmetry below 400 km was largely attributed to photoionisation as plasma in the post-noon sector had been exposed to sunlight for longer than plasma in the pre-noon sector. The plasma flow from the dayside to the nightside was driven by the day-to-night pressure gradient, with the higher plasma densities in the post-noon sector enhancing the nightward transport of ions on the dusk side. The super-rotation of the neutral atmosphere also enhanced the ion flow on the dusk side and reduced the flow on the dawn side due to collisional interactions between the ions and the neutral species. A subsequent modelling study at the altitude of the peak density in the ionosphere (∼140 km) showed that differences in the thermospheric composition between the dawn and dusk sides may also cause asymmetries in the ionosphere at these altitudes due to changes in the dominant chemical reactions (Fox and Kasprzak, 2007).",

(2001, 2002) (from September 8 to 11, 1998) and found that particle precipitation could not account for the observed increase in ionospheric temperature (940–1065 K). The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).",

    "The modeled low shale barrier threshold pressures are potentially indicative of fracturing. However, the current pressure regime is extremely unlikely to cause fracturing, and so it is inferred that the shales may have been pervasively fractured in the past. A fracturing process consistent with the geological history of the region is that the shale barriers have undergone a transient pulse of fluid overpressure sufficient to fracture the rock. Such a pressure history could be a consequence of the rapid unloading of hundreds of meters of ice from the overburden during a deglaciation. A transient ice sheet load equivalent to 10 MPa of overpressure could have been removed rapidly by melting, or instantly by a sea level rise and the flotation of an ice sheet grounded on the seabed, during a typical ablation timespan of less than a few thousand years. At the shallow burial depth of these shales, 10 MPa is sufficient to exceed the tensional rock strength and cause pervasive hydraulic fracturing. This may have happened as a consequence of one or more regional ice sheet excursions into the basin. While the strength and thickness of the overburden at any given ice collapse is unknown, a conservative approximation for the fracture gradient, based on present-day leak-off tests (Nicoll, 2012), suggests that such an event is plausible.",

Thus the temporal sense of a crossing associated with a normal (inbound/outbound) and the tilt of the measured normal with respect to the model normal (sunward/antisunward) tells us if the assumed waves were propagating sunward or tailward. Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 9 show the results of this exercise. 77% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 77% of the dawn side crossings and 76% of the dusk side crossings. Considering that not all of the crossings were necessarily crossings of a boundary perturbed by surface waves, these results support predominantly tailward wave propagation. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show the inferred propagation directions for the crossings associated with waves only. In this case, 89% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 94% of the dawn side crossings and 86% of the dusk side crossings.

    "Using the optimized operating conditions we demonstrate serial passaging and expansion of two integration-free hiPSC lines in completely defined xeno-free media in 100-ml bioreactors. The cells exhibited homogeneous aggregate formation, steady expansion in their pluripotent state, and normal karyotype after ~ 20 passages. Note that one experiment of extended expansion of TNC1 cells in spinner flask (p30 + 6 + 21) showed abnormal karyotype (47, XXY). However, there is no evidence that it should be attributed to the suspension culture. In general, recently improved iPSC culture conditions reduce selective pressure for the growth of mutated cells that acquire growth advantages. Although karyotypically abnormal cells were found occasionally after long-term cultures under both adherent and suspension conditions, the frequency is low (5% of tested batches of hiPSCs and hESCs). The standard karyotyping or other genotyping methods like what we performed here will remain necessary to manage this inherent issue of long-term cell cultures.",

    "By accounting for individual site conditions we confirm that load factors do decline with age, at a similar rate to other rotating machinery. Wind turbines are found to lose 1.6 ± 0.2% of their output per year, with average load factors declining from 28.5% when new to 21% at age 19. This trend is consistent for different generations of turbine design and individual wind farms. This level of degradation reduces a wind farm's output by 12% over a twenty year lifetime, increasing the levelised cost of electricity by 9%.",

    "Sites were surveyed using 2 × 2 m temporary quadrats placed along equally spaced line transects. The separation S (in m) between transects and between quadrats on transects was computed by the formula (Harmer and Morgan, 2009): S=100A/n, where A is the site area (ha) and n the number of quadrats (detailed in Table 1). Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

    "Salts are relevant to the habitability of Mars. First, perchlorate reduction is a metabolism used by some terrestrial bacteria in anaerobic conditions (Coates and Achenbach, 2004). If such organisms exist (or did exist) on Mars, then they could gain energy by reducing perchlorate and oxidizing an electron donor such as organic carbon or ferrous iron. This would require organic molecules to be present on Mars. Indigenous organic molecules have yet to be confirmed on Mars; however the presence of perchlorate itself may have inhibited the detection of organics on Mars in pyrolysis experiments (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010). Second, perchlorate salts are highly deliquescent and significantly lower the freezing point of liquid water (Gough et al., 2011). The eutectic point of Mg(ClO4)2 is −57 °C (Stillman and Grimm, 2011), while that of Ca(ClO4)2 is −75 °C (Pestova et al., 2005). Given typical soil salt concentrations, small amounts of water (∼0.02 g H2O per g soil) would permit a water activity sufficient for terrestrial life to be viable (Kounaves et al., 2010b). Third, if all organisms require fixed nitrogen in proteins and nucleic acids, as they do on Earth, then the discovery of nitrogen oxyanions on Mars would be significant as well.",

    "Thermodynamic modelling using MTDATA software was undertaken in addition to pilot scale tests, in a bid to improve understanding of the likely compounds and associated phase formation of elements under carbonation and calcination conditions. Modelling was undertaken for 4 major elements (C, Ca, O, and H) and up to 9 minor elements (Ba, Cd, Cr, K, Mg, Ni, Sr, Ti, and Zn) based on those which are considered to be most volatile, have the greatest negative impact on the environment and health, and which were present in the highest quantities in the limestone as identified by ICP-MS analysis as outlined in Table 2, in order to investigate partitioning behaviour under pilot scale CO2 capture conditions. The multiphase module of MTDATA was used in the modelling, combined with the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) database, in order to predict compound/phase formation for the complete temperature range, from temperatures of 600 °C, up to 750 °C for carbonation and 1000 °C for calcination, in steps of 20 °C, and at atmospheric pressure.

    "Fig. 18 presents typical bed shear stress time-series estimated from the velocity measurements via the momentum balance, log-law and Reynolds stress methods. The example results shown are for x = 0.772 m on the 1.3 mm sand-rough and 5.4 mm gravel-rough beaches. The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method. Another benefit of the log-law method is that it has been extensively used in the literature, making comparison of our results with previous results more straightforward.",

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

Taken collectively over many orbits the in situ ionospheric measurements cover all local time sectors, with each orbit sampling the terminator region at polar latitudes.

(2005), and (ii) a system where the thermosphere responds on the order of 2 days and, as such, is essentially unresponsive to transient events (Gong, 2005). However, in this study, we do not make a distinction between thermospheric response models. We simply allow the GCM to respond self-consistently to the imposed changes in plasma angular velocity assumed for the transient compressions and expansions, thus allowing a realistic, thermospheric response to these changes.",

Al was identified in the unreacted sample at a weight% of 0.34, but this increased to similar values of 0.67% and 0.66% for 4.5 kg and 6 kg samples respectively, with a much higher value of 3.98% for 13 kg sample of sorbent. This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions.

While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1.

(2001, 2002) (from September 8 to 11, 1998) and found that particle precipitation could not account for the observed increase in ionospheric temperature (940–1065 K). The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).",

The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer.

Thus the temporal sense of a crossing associated with a normal (inbound/outbound) and the tilt of the measured normal with respect to the model normal (sunward/antisunward) tells us if the assumed waves were propagating sunward or tailward. Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 9 show the results of this exercise. 77% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 77% of the dawn side crossings and 76% of the dusk side crossings. Considering that not all of the crossings were necessarily crossings of a boundary perturbed by surface waves, these results support predominantly tailward wave propagation. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show the inferred propagation directions for the crossings associated with waves only. In this case, 89% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 94% of the dawn side crossings and 86% of the dusk side crossings.

    "Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a now large number of studies show smaller 100 ms auditory amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) than healthy controls (HC). In a review of studies examining N1 and M100 in schizophrenia, Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that 100 ms auditory abnormalities are most commonly observed in studies using interstimulus intervals greater than 1 s and that an increase in N1 amplitude by allocation of attention is often lacking in individuals with SZ. Several large-sample studies provide examples. Examining N1 activity in the standard paired-click paradigm, Turetsky et al. (2008) observed a small first and a normal second N1 click response in SZ (N = 142) relative to HC (N = 221). Reduced N1 was also observed in the unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ without co-morbid psychiatric or substance use conditions, and N1 amplitude was observed to be a heritable measure and a better endophenotype than N1 gating. In another recent large-N study, Smith et al. (2010) used simultaneous EEG and MEG to examine 100 ms auditory processes in individuals with SZ (N = 79) and HC (N = 73) during a paired-click task. Patients had larger N1 Cz and left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) M100 ratio scores (second-click/first-click), with EEG and MEG ratio score group differences due to a smaller first click (S1) response in patients, suggesting a deficit in encoding auditory information rather than a deficit in filtering redundant information.",

Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted.

No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows.

    "Fig. 18 presents typical bed shear stress time-series estimated from the velocity measurements via the momentum balance, log-law and Reynolds stress methods. The example results shown are for x = 0.772 m on the 1.3 mm sand-rough and 5.4 mm gravel-rough beaches. The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method. Another benefit of the log-law method is that it has been extensively used in the literature, making comparison of our results with previous results more straightforward.",

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "Fig. 4 shows the density profiles of H, H+, O, and O+ from the C2 model, and the density profile of H from the M7b model. The difference between the transit depths based on the empirical and hydrodynamic models arises because the C2 model has large temperature gradients (Paper I) and a gradual H/H+ transition rather than a sharp cutoff. The difference does not arise because the density profile of the C2 model deviates from hydrostatic equilibrium. Given the temperature gradient in the model, the density profile is almost exactly in hydrostatic equilibrium below 3Rp. In fact, the neutral density profile of the C2 model is better represented by a mean temperature of 6300 K (not shown). This implies that the correspondence of the mean temperature of the empirical model and the pressure averaged temperature of the hydrodynamic model is relatively good but not exact.",

    "Flybys E12 and E13 (middle and right panels of Fig. 2) were nearly identical in terms of the flyby geometry, directly above the north pole of the moon with a minimum distance of only 50 km. Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region. This may be coincidence and has to be checked during the upcoming encounters for consistency.",

    "MRPL12 is the orthologue of eubacterial L7/L12, where L7 is identical to L12 except that it is N-terminal acetylated. L7/L12 is also phosphorylated, which can affect both conformation and binding to partner ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Ref. [37]). This modification has now been confirmed to be present in mammalian MRPL12 [59]. In eubacteria, association of L7/12 to the large subunit takes place via the L10 protein such that two L7/L12 heterodimers normally associate per LSU [60]. Interestingly these dimers are actively exchanged on the 70S molecule without disruption of the ribosomal particle [54,61]. The dimerization status and number of dimers attached to the human 55S has not been clarified. In order to identify if the stoichiometry of MRPL12 per mt-LSU was altered as a consequence of the mutation, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis on subject and control fibroblasts using antibodies to MRPL12. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate demonstrated similar levels small subunit polypeptides including DAP3 and MRPS18B in subject and control samples. In contrast, the total amount of MRPL12 was reduced (Fig. 7B). In the patient the IP is restricted to MRPL12 in the large subunit or the fully assembled 55S with the total amount of MRPL12 being reduced as it lacks the “free” population. The densitometric measurements indicate that the patient IP has ~ 49% MRPL12 compared to control, in accordance with the gradient and steady state data. ICT1 appears to be sensitive to the MRPL12 levels and so is reduced in both the IP (~ 58% of control) and in the steady state westerns (Fig. 4). The lower levels of MRPL12 could reflect loss of multimerization but since the region in the bacterial protein involved in multimerization is towards the N-terminus [62], this mutation is unlikely to have an impact on dimer/multimer formation. The translation factor bound dimer has been suggested to have an increased affinity for the ribosome [54,61]. Thus a possible explanation is that the mutation affects translation factor binding, thereby reducing the affinity of the mutant MRPL12 for the ribosome. If this were the case, however, then we would expect an increase in the pool of free MRPL12 whereas the subject exhibits a reduced pool of free MRPL12, which interacts with POLRMT [57]. The immunoprecipitation was performed using an MRPL12 specific antibody and so should contain all free MRPL12, MRPL12 associated with uncomplexed mt-LSU and MRPL12 as part of the fully assembled 55S. Since the levels of small and large subunit proteins appeared to be similar in subject and control, these data suggest that the mt-LSU and 55S assembly are unaffected by the mutation consistent with the gradient data for the protein and RNA components. Thus the reduced levels of mutant MRPL12 in this subject correspond to i) loss of stability, ii) a decrease in the free pool that is believed to interact with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and iii) reduced translation potentially resulting from decreased interactions with translation factors, but with no detectable increase in aberrant translation products.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct.

    "The XPS analysis also reveals low calcium phosphate levels in the PLGA–HA samples, despite the fact that the fibres are filled with a large amount of nanoparticles. Since XPS is a surface chemical analysis technique (with analysis depth less than 10 nm), this suggests that the nanoparticles lying at the surface of the fibres were embedded in a thin layer of polymer. The presence of carbon observed by XPS at the surface of the HA nanoparticles might result from atmospheric contamination by CO2 and volatile fatty acids. At the surface of the CaP fibres, an additional reason for the presence of carbon might be the existence of residual atoms from the degradation–evaporation of the PLGA polymer. This would explain the higher proportion of carbon when compared to the native HA nanopowder and why the ratio of oxygen to carbon is lower. The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature. For pure HA, this reaction is known to occur at sintering temperatures below 1200 °C with a conversion degree of 0.4 to 0.5 [25]. A simple way to present the reaction formula for dehydroxylation would beCa10(PO4)6(OH)2→Ca10(PO4)6O+H2O",

    "We initially made the assumption that all crossing normals were related to wave activity, even those not part of a clear oscillation. Thus the temporal sense of a crossing associated with a normal (inbound/outbound) and the tilt of the measured normal with respect to the model normal (sunward/antisunward) tells us if the assumed waves were propagating sunward or tailward. Panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 9 show the results of this exercise. 77% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 77% of the dawn side crossings and 76% of the dusk side crossings. Considering that not all of the crossings were necessarily crossings of a boundary perturbed by surface waves, these results support predominantly tailward wave propagation. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show the inferred propagation directions for the crossings associated with waves only. In this case, 89% of the crossings suggest tailward propagation, comprising 94% of the dawn side crossings and 86% of the dusk side crossings. The wave-associated crossings that suggest sunward propagation are all relatively close to the subsolar region.",

At the early stages of swash, however, there is a disagreement: the experimental results show an approximately constant gradient whereas the simulation results suggest a steep increase upon the bore arrival, followed by a gradual decline. At the initial stages of infiltration, when the height of surface water is much greater than the penetration depth, hydraulic gradients are expected to be higher than later on. Furthermore, when the penetration depth is small the experimental error in evaluating gradients is large. For these reasons the discrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is probably due to experimental error.",

STC represent rather favourable operating conditions for most PV technologies as it is an unrealistic combination of a cold module temperature (25 °C) at a high irradiance (1000 W/m2). Different modules, even of the same technology, generally have different rated powers and the energy yields must be made comparable in any inter-comparison study.

    "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES). Moreover, the power used to accelerate the magnetosphere towards corotation is ~7× that of ES, and is shown in Fig. 10(b). These increases lead to a total power per hemisphere of ~2600TW which is three times larger than the responsive thermosphere case in Cowley et al. (2007). These changes in heating and cooling create the local temperature increases discussed above. For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power. The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount. This effectively ‘pulls’ the thermosphere along, increasing its angular velocity in order to return to the steady-state situation where ΩT>ΩM. We note that energy dissipated via Joule heating also decreases slightly due to the small decrease in flow shear. Overall, then, the total power per hemisphere in case EF is only 30% that of case ES.",

The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f.

The numerical predictions of the pore-air pressure build-up within the two sediments are in good agreement with the large-scale laboratory measurements. The time when pressure first changes (i.e. the arrival of the pressure front) is well-predicted across the swash zone, as are the magnitudes of pressure head during uprush and backwash. The numerical model captures well the groundwater response to surface–subsurface water exchange, with reasonable agreement between the model-predicted and measured exit point during the backwash.

    "Melin et al. (2006) analysed infrared data from an auroral heating event observed by Stallard et al. (2001, 2002) (from September 8 to 11, 1998) and found that particle precipitation could not account for the observed increase in ionospheric temperature (940–1065 K). The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).",

    "Sites were surveyed using 2 × 2 m temporary quadrats placed along equally spaced line transects. The separation S (in m) between transects and between quadrats on transects was computed by the formula (Harmer and Morgan, 2009): S=100A/n, where A is the site area (ha) and n the number of quadrats (detailed in Table 1). Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

    "Shear-band yielding has previously been reported for the present epoxy-polymer formulation when particle modified [33], and was observed during the present plane–strain compression tests. The DN-4PB tests of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers were performed to investigate the process further. After fracture at 20 °C, the plastic zone at the tip of the sub-critically loaded crack was sectioned and observed using transmission optical microscopy. This showed that a large feather-like deformation zone was formed, see Fig. 16. This feather-like zone comprises highly plastically dilated cavities and localised shear-bands [12,48]. Transmission optical micrographs of the subsurface damage zone of the S-CSR particle-modified epoxy polymers tested at different temperatures revealed that the size of the subsurface damage zone decreased as the test temperature decreased, see Fig. 17. This reduction in the size of the deformation zone ahead of the crack tip is due to the increase of the yield stress of the epoxy polymer at low temperatures.",

    "As noted in the Introduction, Naatanen and Picton (1987) argued that the electric N1 reflects contributions from frontal sources as well as from primary auditory cortex. Present results provide confirmation of these findings, with frontal activity observed in both groups (Fig. 2). Findings are also consistent with imaging studies that have observed frontal activity during auditory tasks.22Although many paired-click studies have examined the association between frontal activity and gating measures (e.g., second click divided by first click), studies examining associations between paired-click ratio scores and frontal activity but not also associations between first click activity and frontal activity are not discussed as findings between ratio scores and frontal activity are outside the scope of this study (e.g., EEG studies such as Williams et al.

For example, examining auditory responses in patients with epilepsy using intracranial microelectrode grids, Korzyukov et al. (2007) detected 50 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity, findings consistent with earlier corticography studies suggesting frontal contributions to P50 (Grunwald et al., 2003). Boutros et al.

Similar to present findings in controls, Boutros et al. observed activity in the posterior part of STG and in left ventral prefrontal cortex (more exact comparisons between the two studies in terms of frontal activity are difficult, as many subjects in Boutros et al. did not have electrodes placed in anterior frontal regions). Boutros et al. (2011) also observed 100 ms auditory activity in middle temporal gyrus, parietal, cingulate, and occipital regions. Activity observed in similar but not identical locations in these other areas in the present study may be due to the significant latency variability Boutros et al. (2011) observed in several regions.

In the C0 evaluation, S1 progenies flowered three weeks later than the FS. This was due to poorer S1 plant establishment after a severe drought that occurred after planting. Relatively high panicle yield (484 g m−2) was recorded in C3 in the FS, which was due to the favorable 2009 rainy season conditions. Since both S1 and FS progenies were evaluated in separate field trials, and since both S1 and FS selection schemes were combined, a real comparison of means and selection efficiencies is not possible in this study.",

    "SEM–EDS analysis of sorbent sampled from the carbonator after each test was undertaken to determine the percentage weight of the elemental species present. The results as shown in Fig. 8 confirm that increasing bed inventory generally increases the presence of Al, Fe and Cu. Al was identified in the unreacted sample at a weight% of 0.34, but this increased to similar values of 0.67% and 0.66% for 4.5 kg and 6 kg samples respectively, with a much higher value of 3.98% for 13 kg sample of sorbent. This increase in Al% weight with increasing sorbent mass may be because there is a greater amount of Al present originally, or because the limestone acts as a sorbent for Al, which is also considered the case for Fe and Cu. Further, Al is likely to form Ca aluminates which are important constituents of cement. The EDS results indicate similar quantities of C, O and Ca between tests, although values for the samples that had undergone testing are slightly lower for C and O, and slightly higher for Ca, compared to the unreacted limestone sample, implying that the small change was a result of chemical reactions. Although the values are small, a steady decrease in Si weight% was recorded with increasing sorbent mass, implying removal of Si from limestone in the capture process. However the lowest value was recorded for the unreacted limestone.",

    "In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

The bottom left half of the figure (below the thick red line) represents a range of observed temperatures on Saturn (400–650 K) and thus of “allowed” combinations of electric field strength and particle flux. In contrast, combinations of these two magnetospheric forcing parameters that result in temperatures in the top right part of the figure (above the red line) need to be treated with caution as they produce temperatures in excess of observations. A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values.

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

Our findings over a large corpus of C code was that 89% of the programs studied contained at least one dependence cluster composed of 10% or more of the program's statements.

A transient compression event consists of an initially expanded, steady-state magnetospheric configuration.

Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region.

However, some samples were intentionally subsequently contaminated with iron, using the same procedure as in Refs. [23,34,35]. This involved rubbing the back-side of the sample with iron pieces (99.95% purity from Testbourne Limited, UK). Samples were then annealed in air in a pre-heated furnace at temperatures up to 798 °C for times chosen to ensure complete iron diffusion through the sample. Although our intention was to contaminate samples only with iron, the possibility that other transition metal impurities have entered the samples cannot be completely ruled out. Cooling was rapid, with the samples removed from the furnace at temperature and placed on a heat sink. It is estimated that samples were cooled to below ∼100 °C in <10 s.

The separation S (in m) between transects and between quadrats on transects was computed by the formula (Harmer and Morgan, 2009): S=100A/n, where A is the site area (ha) and n the number of quadrats (detailed in Table 1). Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "The Venusian ionosphere exhibited a number of asymmetries between the dawn and dusk sectors. Brace et al. (1982) observed that the ionopause was higher on the dawn side than at dusk due to interaction with the solar wind. Miller and Knudsen (1987) reported larger antisunward velocities within the ionosphere on the dawn side than on the dusk side above an altitude of 400 km, with the pattern reversed below this altitude. The dawn–dusk asymmetry below 400 km was largely attributed to photoionisation as plasma in the post-noon sector had been exposed to sunlight for longer than plasma in the pre-noon sector. The plasma flow from the dayside to the nightside was driven by the day-to-night pressure gradient, with the higher plasma densities in the post-noon sector enhancing the nightward transport of ions on the dusk side. The super-rotation of the neutral atmosphere also enhanced the ion flow on the dusk side and reduced the flow on the dawn side due to collisional interactions between the ions and the neutral species. A subsequent modelling study at the altitude of the peak density in the ionosphere (∼140 km) showed that differences in the thermospheric composition between the dawn and dusk sides may also cause asymmetries in the ionosphere at these altitudes due to changes in the dominant chemical reactions (Fox and Kasprzak, 2007).",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",

    "Great care was taken to avoid contamination of the samples by metallic impurities during the oxygen precipitation process. However, some samples were intentionally subsequently contaminated with iron, using the same procedure as in Refs. [23,34,35]. This involved rubbing the back-side of the sample with iron pieces (99.95% purity from Testbourne Limited, UK). Samples were then annealed in air in a pre-heated furnace at temperatures up to 798 °C for times chosen to ensure complete iron diffusion through the sample. Although our intention was to contaminate samples only with iron, the possibility that other transition metal impurities have entered the samples cannot be completely ruled out. Cooling was rapid, with the samples removed from the furnace at temperature and placed on a heat sink. It is estimated that samples were cooled to below ∼100 °C in <10 s. Samples which were not intentionally contaminated with iron are referred to as “uncontaminated” samples in this paper, although it is possible that the low levels of impurity contamination in such samples have significant effects, as discussed later.",

    "Metal–organic framework (MOF) complexes are a sub-class of porous solids which show great promise for gas storage and separation due to their high surface area, low framework density, and tuneable functional pore environment [3]. MOF materials are usually built up from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers to afford 3D extended frameworks with the formation of cavities ranging from microporous to mesoporous region. Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77 K) [4] with a record of ∼16 wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6]. However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material. There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use. In situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at below 10 K has been used previously to determine the locations of D2 within a few best-behaving MOF materials incorporating exposed metal sites [7–12]. It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state. These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities. Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study. Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.",

However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2 MPa and 34 °C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73 MPa and 38 °C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260 kg/m3 at the injection point (38 °C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320 kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34 °C) (Fig. 3).",

    "Fig. 18 presents typical bed shear stress time-series estimated from the velocity measurements via the momentum balance, log-law and Reynolds stress methods. The example results shown are for x = 0.772 m on the 1.3 mm sand-rough and 5.4 mm gravel-rough beaches. The results from the 1.3 mm sand-rough beach show a good overall agreement between the momentum balance and the log law method. The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small. The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress. For the gravel-rough beaches the accuracy of the measurements was not sufficient to obtain useful estimates from the momentum balance method (lower panel of Fig. 18). The limitation of the control volume size relative to the size of the sediments appears to have negatively affected the results. Therefore, even though the momentum balance method is better-founded theoretically than the log-law method, in the following we concentrate on bed shear stress results obtained using the log-law method. Another benefit of the log-law method is that it has been extensively used in the literature, making comparison of our results with previous results more straightforward.",

    "For the square configuration, the mutual topology performed better than the separate topology. One observed issue with the separate topology is that the turbines in front easily get high rotational velocities for the peak wind speeds. It is shown in Ref. [11] that for rapid increases in wind speed, the turbine temporarily obtains a higher rotational velocity and power before the wake has formed. For rapid decreases in wind speed, the existing wake causes an additional drop in wind speed. Hence the rotational velocity and the extracted power drop below the steady state value before the wake has drifted away. For the square configuration, a rapid increase in wind speed causes the front turbine to obtain a high rotational velocity, which generates a large wake behind the turbine. This large wake will drift into the downwind turbine, hence reducing the rotational velocity of the second turbine. This effect is seen in Fig. 15 at 1050 and 1170 s, where an increase in rotational velocity for turbines 1 and 3 in the separate case is followed by a rapid decrease in rotational velocity for turbine 3. The mutual topology does not suffer from this issue, as it prevents the turbines in the front from obtaining too high rotational velocities, while keeping the rotational velocity of the turbines in the back higher.",

    "The XPS analysis also reveals low calcium phosphate levels in the PLGA–HA samples, despite the fact that the fibres are filled with a large amount of nanoparticles. Since XPS is a surface chemical analysis technique (with analysis depth less than 10 nm), this suggests that the nanoparticles lying at the surface of the fibres were embedded in a thin layer of polymer. The presence of carbon observed by XPS at the surface of the HA nanoparticles might result from atmospheric contamination by CO2 and volatile fatty acids. At the surface of the CaP fibres, an additional reason for the presence of carbon might be the existence of residual atoms from the degradation–evaporation of the PLGA polymer. This would explain the higher proportion of carbon when compared to the native HA nanopowder and why the ratio of oxygen to carbon is lower. The slightly lower percentage of oxygen in CaP fibres, compared to the HA nanopowder, may result from the loss of OH groups (dehydroxylation) that occur at high temperature. For pure HA, this reaction is known to occur at sintering temperatures below 1200 °C with a conversion degree of 0.4 to 0.5 [25]. A simple way to present the reaction formula for dehydroxylation would beCa10(PO4)6(OH)2→Ca10(PO4)6O+H2O",

In a previous study Barlow et al. (2011b) carried out wind tunnel simulations of the flow around BT Tower and the lattice tower on which the anemometer is located. During these simulations it was observed that both the tower and the lattice distorted the flow at the position of a sonic anemometer installed on top of the lattice, and correction factors were developed for this position. These correction factors cannot be directly applied to the data presented here, as the sonic anemometer has been moved since the original installation. Although the corrections applied by Barlow et al. (2011b) were small (≈2% of the mean wind speed), data from the sonic anemometer are examined here to determine whether flow distortion has a substantial effect on the instrument in this new position.

Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels.

A magnetospheric electric field of ∼100 mV m−1 mapped into the ionosphere would in combination with at 10 keV electron flux of 1 mW m−2 generate thermosphere temperatures of ∼800 K, well in excess of observed values.

The separation S (in m) between transects and between quadrats on transects was computed by the formula (Harmer and Morgan, 2009): S=100A/n, where A is the site area (ha) and n the number of quadrats (detailed in Table 1). Quadrats on forest track margins were omitted. In total we surveyed 1140 quadrats. Within each quadrat the species, number and height of all regenerating juveniles (defined here as either seedlings with a height ⩽50 cm or saplings with a height >50 cm) were noted. The height of saplings was measured with an extensible folding rule. The incidence of leading stems damaged by browsing on trees <2 m tall was noted. No attempt was made to distinguish the different birch, oak and willow spp. The distance to the nearest seed source (defined as a mature tree) was measured in the field for each tree species (all the sampled plots lay within 250 m of a native seed source). Within each quadrat we recorded the percentage of quadrat area beneath the canopy of each vascular plant species (as 2 or more species can overlap, this can result in a total vegetation cover of more than 100%) as well as the percentage cover of decaying woody debris (stumps, fallen logs and brash). Soil samples were taken from each quadrat and the pH was measured electrometrically using a soil–water paste. We were interested in the effect of brash on regeneration density so in sites that had been recently clearfelled (U6a, F2 and F4) a transect with equally spaced quadrats was oriented along a windrow and, parallel to this, another transect along the adjacent area (interrow) between the windrows. It was not possible to do this analysis on sites that had been clearfelled more than a few years ago as the vegetation growth and rotting of the brash made it increasingly difficult to discern windrows.",

The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature. Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate. Thus, a net increase in ionospheric temperature resulted. More detailed analysis showed that these cooling mechanisms would be unlikely to return the thermosphere to its initial temperature before the onset of subsequent heating events. Melin et al. (2006) thus concluded that the temperature increases could plausibly lead to an increase in equatorward winds, which transport thermal energy to lower latitudes (Waite et al., 1983).",

    "Flybys E12 and E13 (middle and right panels of Fig. 2) were nearly identical in terms of the flyby geometry, directly above the north pole of the moon with a minimum distance of only 50 km. Cassini was slightly downstream of the moon during encounter E12 and slightly upstream during E13. The details of the measurements for those two flybys are shown in Fig. 4. Intensities of electrons with different energies and look directions are shown in detail in the upper four panels on a linear scale. The lower two panels show the measured local pitch angle (115° during E12 and about 75° for E13) of the low-energy telescope of MIMI/LEMMS and the azimuthal component of the measured magnetic field Bϕ. We use sometimes the Bϕ component as an index of field-aligned current perturbations in the system. Such currents may exist in the Alfvén-wing system or represent discontinuities as predicted by Saur et al. (2007). Discontinuities in Bϕ could be useful in identifying the location where Cassini was magnetically connected to the surface of Enceladus. The intensities for electrons with tens to hundreds keV energies (e.g. in channel C3) show a “ramp”- or step-like depletion (marked by red and green areas in Fig. 4A) before or after the deep absorption signature. The electron intensity drops gradually or sometimes in two steps from magnetospheric levels to background levels. It is interesting that the sharp ramps are mostly seen in the sub-Saturn upstream and in the anti-Saturn downstream region. This may be coincidence and has to be checked during the upcoming encounters for consistency.",

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1.

    "The modeled low shale barrier threshold pressures are potentially indicative of fracturing. However, the current pressure regime is extremely unlikely to cause fracturing, and so it is inferred that the shales may have been pervasively fractured in the past. A fracturing process consistent with the geological history of the region is that the shale barriers have undergone a transient pulse of fluid overpressure sufficient to fracture the rock. Such a pressure history could be a consequence of the rapid unloading of hundreds of meters of ice from the overburden during a deglaciation. A transient ice sheet load equivalent to 10 MPa of overpressure could have been removed rapidly by melting, or instantly by a sea level rise and the flotation of an ice sheet grounded on the seabed, during a typical ablation timespan of less than a few thousand years. At the shallow burial depth of these shales, 10 MPa is sufficient to exceed the tensional rock strength and cause pervasive hydraulic fracturing. This may have happened as a consequence of one or more regional ice sheet excursions into the basin. While the strength and thickness of the overburden at any given ice collapse is unknown, a conservative approximation for the fracture gradient, based on present-day leak-off tests (Nicoll, 2012), suggests that such an event is plausible.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2. A fitted profile plot for the PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 1.

    "The mitochondrial machinery responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) comprises five enzyme complexes containing approximately 80 proteins of which only 13 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [1]. OXPHOS deficiencies affecting a single or multiple complexes can result from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes and are associated with a variety of disease mechanisms [2,3]. With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing there is an increasing number of pathogenic mutations being identified that are not solely restricted to the 80 genes encoding OXPHOS components, thus highlighting the importance of mechanisms impacting on mitochondrial gene expression [4,5]. Combined OXPHOS deficiencies can arise from alterations in mtDNA, its maintenance [6], cardiolipin levels [7,8], or where none of these are affected, from direct defects in synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins [9]. This last group constitutes a heterogeneous mix of patients suffering from a wide range of clinical symptoms making clinical diagnosis difficult [10]. Genetic diagnosis is yet more elusive in children with mitochondrial disease where unidentified nuclear mutations account for the majority of cases [11]. This diagnostic problem is compounded by our relatively poor understanding of the complex molecular machinery that drives translation in mitochondria. This machinery comprises over a hundred proteins [12], all of which are putative candidate genes for translation deficiencies in human. Indeed, translation deficiencies represent a growing cause of multiple OXPHOS deficiencies with several published pathogenic mutations in genes related to the intra-organellar protein synthesis. Although many mutations associated with impaired mitochondrial translation currently map to tRNA genes [13] and a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [14], the list of nuclear gene mutations is steadily growing as mutations in genes encoding mitochondrial translation factors such as GFM1 (OMIM: 606639) [15,16], TSFM (OMIM: 604723) [17] and TUFM (OMIM: 602389) [18]; mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RARS2 (OMIM: 611524) [19], DARS2 (OMIM: 610956) [20], YARS2 (OMIM: 610957) [21], SARS2 (OMIM: 612804) [22], HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) [23], AARS2 (OMIM: 612035) [24], MARS2 (OMIM: 609728) [25], EARS2 (OMIM: 612799) [26]), FARS2 (OMIM: 611592) [27]; tRNA-modifying enzymes (PUS1 (OMIM: 608109) [28], TRMU (OMIM: 610230) [29], MTO1 (OMIM: 614667) [30]); other factors (C12orf65 (OMIM: 613541) [31], TACO1 (OMIM: 612958) [32], LRPPRC (OMIM: 607544) [33], C12orf62 (OMIM: 614478) [34]) and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS16 (OMIM: 609204) [35], MRPS22 (OMIM: 605810) [36], MRPL3 (OMIM: 607118) [5]) have been successively reported (reviewed in Ref. [14]). Relatively few cases of OXPHOS deficiencies associated with mutations in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) have been described so far. MRPS16 mutations have been described in only one family with agenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphism. MRPS22 mutations lead to cardiomyopathy, hypotonia and tubulopathy in a first family and Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in another family. Finally, we recently identified MRPL3 mutations in four siblings of the same family presenting cardiomyopathy and psychomotor retardation. Since the mammalian mitoribosome (55S) is ~ 2 megadalton machine consisting of approximately 80 components that make up the 28S small (SSU) and 39S large subunit (LSU), it is likely that more pathogenic mutations in the constituent polypeptides will be uncovered. One of the substantial differences between the mammalian mitoribosome and those of eubacteria (70S) or the eukaryotic cytosol (80S) is the reversal in the protein to rRNA ratio. The 70S and 80S particles contain ~ 70% rRNA, whilst human mitoribosomes contain ~ 70% protein. This change in the ratio represents both an acquisition of new MRPs as well as loss of bacterial orthologues [37,38]. MRPL12 does have a bacterial orthologue, which through its interactions with translation factors is important in protein synthesis regulating both speed and accuracy [39–41].",

    "Fig. 4 shows the AFM images and corresponding 3D profiles of SiC wafer, CDC layer and dual-layer film, indicating surface morphology evolution in the process. The as-received SiC surface in Fig. 4a and b is characterized by highly uniform and flat terraces. The surface roughness RMS (root mean square roughness) is evaluated as 0.22 nm. The step direction and terrace width are determined by the incidental disorientation of the substrate surface with respect to the crystallographic (0001) plane [26]. The step height is smaller than that of the dimension of the 6H-SiC unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the surface (c axis), which may resulted from the silicon oxide layer. The morphology of the CDC layer prepared by chlorination is shown in Fig. 4c and d. The SiC surface undergoes significant modification: it is now covered with numerous nanopores up to 100 nm in width, and the original are disappeared. The formation of CDC is accompanied by substantial changes in the morphology, leading to a considerable increasing surface roughness of 1.46 nm. As a consequence of chlorination, the CDC layer possesses a nanoporous structure and an increasing specific surface area on the surface [6,27]. The nanopores can easily capture the carbon species from the gas phase for the subsequent CVD process, which benefits the nucleation and growth of the CVD layer. After the CVD process, the surface morphology is characterized by spherical or ellipsoidal particles, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The size of carbon particles is up to approximately 3 μm in diameter, and the surface roughness is substantially increased to 54.68 nm in RMS.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct.

Thus we can make the more general statement that for low to moderate electric field strength Saturn’s thermospheric temperatures are more responsive to changes in electric field strength than incident energetic electron flux of 10 keV particles. Temperatures are less responsive to changes in energy flux for soft (500 eV) electrons (not shown) as these do not penetrate deep enough into the atmosphere to significantly affect Pedersen and Hall conductances (Galand et al., 2011).",

    "Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a now large number of studies show smaller 100 ms auditory amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) than healthy controls (HC). In a review of studies examining N1 and M100 in schizophrenia, Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that 100 ms auditory abnormalities are most commonly observed in studies using interstimulus intervals greater than 1 s and that an increase in N1 amplitude by allocation of attention is often lacking in individuals with SZ. Several large-sample studies provide examples. Examining N1 activity in the standard paired-click paradigm, Turetsky et al. (2008) observed a small first and a normal second N1 click response in SZ (N = 142) relative to HC (N = 221). Reduced N1 was also observed in the unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ without co-morbid psychiatric or substance use conditions, and N1 amplitude was observed to be a heritable measure and a better endophenotype than N1 gating. In another recent large-N study, Smith et al. (2010) used simultaneous EEG and MEG to examine 100 ms auditory processes in individuals with SZ (N = 79) and HC (N = 73) during a paired-click task. Patients had larger N1 Cz and left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) M100 ratio scores (second-click/first-click), with EEG and MEG ratio score group differences due to a smaller first click (S1) response in patients, suggesting a deficit in encoding auditory information rather than a deficit in filtering redundant information.",

    "Performances of the three classifiers are shown in Table 1, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) are plotted in Fig. 5. While the sMRI classifier and fMRI classifier performed well individually, their combination achieved a significant improvement in performance. The combined classifier yielded AUC and EER as high as 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. From the ROC, we can see that the sMRI classifier could not predict some of the positive subjects (HI) correctly even when the decision threshold was set to be very low, because the classifier did not reach 100% true positive rate even when the false positive rate approached 100%. However, the ROC for fMRI was in an opposite situation. The ROC did not reach 0% false positive rate even when the true positive rate approached 0%, suggesting that the fMRI classifier had difficulty in classifying some of the negative subjects (NH) correctly. As sMRI and fMRI classifiers were vulnerable to different types of errors, it was possible to combine them to overcome their individual limitations. To illustrate the reason why the combination can be successful, we plotted sMRI–fMRI scores in Fig. 6 and S1. Simply speaking, the fMRI classifier draws a horizontal line to separate the two groups of subjects based on the fMRI data, while the sMRI classifier draws a vertical line to separate the two groups based on the sMRI data. Obviously, the two groups could not be perfectly separated by either a horizontal or a vertical line in Fig. 6 and S1. However, by combining the fMRI and sMRI classifiers, the two groups of subjects were separable with a diagonal line as shown in the figures.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2. A fitted profile plot for the PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 1.

    "Metal–organic framework (MOF) complexes are a sub-class of porous solids which show great promise for gas storage and separation due to their high surface area, low framework density, and tuneable functional pore environment [3]. MOF materials are usually built up from metal ions or clusters bridged by organic linkers to afford 3D extended frameworks with the formation of cavities ranging from microporous to mesoporous region. Several members within this MOF family have achieved impressively high H2 adsorption capacities (albeit at cryogenic temperatures, typically at 77 K) [4] with a record of ∼16 wt% total uptake capacity observed in NU-100 [5] and MOF-200 [6]. However, these high uptake capacities drop dramatically with increasing temperature, and thus none is a practical material. There is thus particular emphasis on optimising the interactions between MOF hosts and adsorbed H2 molecules, and the identification of specific binding interactions and properties of gases within confined space represents an important methodology for the development of better materials that may lead us to systems of practical use. In situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at below 10 K has been used previously to determine the locations of D2 within a few best-behaving MOF materials incorporating exposed metal sites [7–12]. It has been found that D2 can bind directly to vacant sites on metal centres, and that the adsorbed D2 molecules have molecular separations comparable to that to D2 in the solid state. These studies have provided invaluable structural rationale for their observed high gas adsorption capacities. Research has thus focused understandably on MOFs with high H2 uptake capacities, while materials showing very low H2 uptake and/or incorporate fully coordinated metal centres are often ignored for this study. Therefore, information on binding interactions within those low-uptake MOF systems is entirely lacking, but can still give important complementary data and potential understanding for the subsequent design and optimisation of hydrogen storage materials.",

    "Data were collected at both sites on a plot basis for traits related to pearl millet phenological and agronomical characters, downy mildew (DM) incidence, and Striga resistance. The flowering time (FLO) in days after sowing (das) was recorded when 50% of the plants had exerted stigmas. During harvest, the number of productive panicles was counted and weighed to determine the panicle yield (HYD) (g m−2). The number of hills per plot with downy mildew was recorded at tillering, verified/adjusted after flowering and used for calculating the downy mildew (DM) incidence (in percentage): number of infested hills, divided by the total number of hills after emergence, multiplied by 100. In addition, the number of emerged Striga plants for each plot was recorded at 67, 101 and 121 das. Successive Striga counts were then used to calculate the “Area under Striga Number Progress Curve” (ASNPC) (Haussmann et al., 2000):ASNPC=∑i=0n−1Yi+Y(i+1)2(t(i+1)−ti)where n is the number of Striga assessment dates, Yi the Striga count at the ith assessment date, ti the days after sowing at the ith assessment date, t0 is 0, and Y0 is 0.

    "Using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), a now large number of studies show smaller 100 ms auditory amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) than healthy controls (HC). In a review of studies examining N1 and M100 in schizophrenia, Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that 100 ms auditory abnormalities are most commonly observed in studies using interstimulus intervals greater than 1 s and that an increase in N1 amplitude by allocation of attention is often lacking in individuals with SZ. Several large-sample studies provide examples. Examining N1 activity in the standard paired-click paradigm, Turetsky et al. (2008) observed a small first and a normal second N1 click response in SZ (N = 142) relative to HC (N = 221). Reduced N1 was also observed in the unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ without co-morbid psychiatric or substance use conditions, and N1 amplitude was observed to be a heritable measure and a better endophenotype than N1 gating. In another recent large-N study, Smith et al. (2010) used simultaneous EEG and MEG to examine 100 ms auditory processes in individuals with SZ (N = 79) and HC (N = 73) during a paired-click task. Patients had larger N1 Cz and left and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) M100 ratio scores (second-click/first-click), with EEG and MEG ratio score group differences due to a smaller first click (S1) response in patients, suggesting a deficit in encoding auditory information rather than a deficit in filtering redundant information.",

    "K10 demonstrated that absorption by hydrogen in the extended thermosphere of HD209458b explains the transits in the H Lyman α line, and used the observations to constrain the mean temperature and composition of the thermosphere. They fitted both the line-integrated transit depth based on the low resolution G140L data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004; Ben-Jaffel and Hosseini, 2010), and the transit depths and light curve based on the medium resolution G140M data (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2003; Ben-Jaffel, 2007, 2008) (see Figs. 5 and 6 of K10 for the results). The results imply that the lower boundary of the absorbing layer of H is at p0 = 0.1–1 μbar, the mean temperature within the layer is T¯=8000–11,000K, and the upper boundary is at r∞ = 2.7Rp. Recent photochemical calculations imply that H2 dissociates near the 1 μbar level (e.g., Paper I, Moses et al., 2011), and this is also supported by an observational lower limit for the vertical column density of H (France et al., 2010). Hence the mean temperature in the thermosphere of HD209458b is approximately 8250 K (the M7 model of K10).",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",

    "As noted in the Introduction, Naatanen and Picton (1987) argued that the electric N1 reflects contributions from frontal sources as well as from primary auditory cortex. Present results provide confirmation of these findings, with frontal activity observed in both groups (Fig. 2). Findings are also consistent with imaging studies that have observed frontal activity during auditory tasks.22Although many paired-click studies have examined the association between frontal activity and gating measures (e.g., second click divided by first click), studies examining associations between paired-click ratio scores and frontal activity but not also associations between first click activity and frontal activity are not discussed as findings between ratio scores and frontal activity are outside the scope of this study (e.g., EEG studies such as Williams et al. (2011) and fMRI studies such as Tregellas et al. (2007) and Mayer et al. (2009)). For example, examining auditory responses in patients with epilepsy using intracranial microelectrode grids, Korzyukov et al. (2007) detected 50 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity, findings consistent with earlier corticography studies suggesting frontal contributions to P50 (Grunwald et al., 2003). Boutros et al. (2011) also detected 100 ms temporal and frontal auditory activity using subdural electrodes. Similar to present findings in controls, Boutros et al. observed activity in the posterior part of STG and in left ventral prefrontal cortex (more exact comparisons between the two studies in terms of frontal activity are difficult, as many subjects in Boutros et al. did not have electrodes placed in anterior frontal regions). Boutros et al. (2011) also observed 100 ms auditory activity in middle temporal gyrus, parietal, cingulate, and occipital regions. Activity observed in similar but not identical locations in these other areas in the present study may be due to the significant latency variability Boutros et al. (2011) observed in several regions. Variability across subjects in the location of activation may also account for study differences.",

    "A limitation of the present study is that most subjects were chronic patients and all patients were on medication. As such, it is not possible to determine whether the observed abnormalities are observed only in chronic patients or whether group differences were due to medication. Several studies, however, show that 100 ms abnormalities in schizophrenia are present at first onset as well as in first-degree relatives (Turetsky et al., 2008), suggesting that auditory abnormalities in SZ are not due to medication. In addition, in a review of 100 ms auditory studies Rosburg et al. (2008) concluded that medication did not seem to account for group differences in N100 activity.",

    "To prevent ocean acidification and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to capture and store carbon dioxide. The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.",

    "An off-white powder, Mg3NF3 (1) was successfully synthesised at 1323 K. Initial powder diffraction measurements produced a pattern that matched the ICDD database entry (PDF Card number 25-0517). Indexing of the peaks gave a cubic unit cell with a=4.2153(4) Å, which is in good agreement with the literature value of 4.216 Å [3]. Longer PXD scans revealed the presence of a small impurity of the MgF2 reagent, which was included as a secondary phase in the final cycles of the refinement and refined to a final phase fraction of 1.1(2) wt%. Given the similarity in form factor for isoelectronic N3− and F−, obtaining a definitive structure for 1 in which partial site disorder could be categorically discarded from PXD data alone was not possible. PND data were collected to address this problem as there is sufficient contrast in the coherent neutron scattering lengths to allow a convincing solution to be obtained (N: b=9.36 fm, F: b=5.65 fm) [28]. Starting from the refined PXD model, the refinement progressed smoothly and converged to produce a good fit to the data. Attempts to refine occupancies of the anion sites to investigate possible N/F disorder reduced the quality of the fit, increased R-factors and caused some parameters to become unstable, indicating an ordered model in which N3− occupies only the 1b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site and F− the 3d (1/2, 0, 0) site to be correct. The details of the both PXD and PND refinements can be found in Table 1. Important interatomic distances can be found in Table 2. A fitted profile plot for the PND data for the backscattering bank (〈2θ〉=145°) is shown in Fig. 1. (Additional refinement fits and a table of anisotropic thermal displacement parameters can be found in the Supplementary information.)",

Taken collectively over many orbits the in situ ionospheric measurements cover all local time sectors, with each orbit sampling the terminator region at polar latitudes. In the current study these observations are used to determine the plasma distribution near the terminator and to show that the transport process contributes to the maintenance of the nightside ionosphere close to solar minimum.",

    "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is a persistent threat to pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone, comb. nov.] production, especially in West Africa. This study aimed at evaluating the response of a diversified pearl millet genepool to five cycles of recurrent selection targeting Striga resistance and panicle yield, and to a lesser extent downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schroet.] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa.",
