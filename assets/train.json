With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women). Since the phase 1 medical examination, follow-up examinations have taken place approximately every 5 years: phase 3 (1991 to 1993, n = 8815); phase 5 (1997 to 1999, n = 7870); phase 7 (2003 to 2004, n = 6967); and phase 9 (2008 to 2009, n = 6761). Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here.

    "Environmental changes associated with the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, ∼56 Ma) have not yet been documented in detail from the North Sea Basin. Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54 °N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments. The CIE onset is identified from organic matter δ13C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence. Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass. Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103 yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle. Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM. Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores. This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate. A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.",

    "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5–10 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.",

    "It is possible to explain such observations in general if we consider MEX to be above a region that has accelerated electrons upwards, in which case heavy-ions could also be accelerated downwards. This may explain the appearance of the very low DEF of heavy-ions at ∼400eV. However, due to the finite gyro-radius effect it is also plausible that the general behaviour of the heavy-ions flowing away from Mars may not change, even when passing an acceleration region. The gyroradius of heavy-ions with energies around ∼10eV at the location of the accelerated electron signature is around 100 km, which is of a similar spatial scale to the horizontal size of a closed crustal magnetic field line at 400 km. Therefore, it is possible the heavy-ions do not remain in the acceleration region long enough to experience its effects.",

This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4).

    "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.",

    "A total of 71 palynology samples were prepared at the British Geological Survey using standard preparation procedures (Moore et al., 1991). Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C. Foraminifera samples between 20 and 60 g of dried sediment were processed by washing through a 63 μm sieve with water. All specimens were counted and converted to foraminifera/g (Table S2). All species exhibited agglutinated (non calcareous) test walls.",

    "Tinnitus is the perception of sounds in the head or ears, usually defined as a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound. Tinnitus can be objective or subjective. Objective tinnitus is caused by sounds generated by an internal biological activity. However, subjective tinnitus is much more common and results from abnormal neural activities which are not formed by sounds [1]. Subjective tinnitus is a common and disturbing phenomenon, with a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 20% [2–5] in the general population, and an estimated 10 year incidence rate in adults aged over 48 years of 13% [6]. Approximately 5% of the population is severely affected by their tinnitus [7], for example experiencing sleep disorders, concentration difficulties, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.",

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

    "The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere. Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.",

We showed that co-deposition of blended mixtures leads to 60% higher photocurrents than in thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts [37]. Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ we improved their power conversion efficiency by as much as 80%, achieving performance comparable to PTh:PCBM equivalents processed in solution from thermo-cleavable precursors [52]. An enhanced photoresponse results from the favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing, modestly larger grain sizes and increased crystallization of C60. In contrast to most small-molecule blends, annealing-induced phase separation does not lead to formation of microcrystals but rather to a controlled improvement of the donor–acceptor network. This is an inherent advantage of polymers over molecular systems.",

    "Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.",

    "The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 ± 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of ∼0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest ⩽1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.",

The mt-LSU protein ICT1 was also decreased (~ 30% of control values) as was MRPL3 (by 37%) suggesting that a consequence of the MRPL12 mutation is a global defect in assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU). In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

    "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.",

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

    "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5–10 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.",

    "An energy-based criterion was used to predict debonding of the particles. The method used has been fully described elsewhere [49] and essentially it proposes that the criterion for debonding is based upon the energy released by the debonding process. To obtain the parameters needed for this energy-based criterion, a finite-element analysis modelling study has been used to derive the change in strain-energy arising from the cavitation process, with the addition of the strain-energy stored in the particle prior to debonding. The applied stress used for these simulations was derived from experimental observations. Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size. It has therefore been assumed that the debonding takes place at an applied uniaxial stress of about 70 MPa, which equates to a hydrostatic stress at the crack tip of about 210 MPa. Thus, the finite-element analysis simulations were analysed for an applied hydrostatic stress of 210 MPa.",

    "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

    "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.",

    "To meet these challenges fertilizers recommendations to farmers become a common practice worldwide generally optimizing fertilizer doses to sustain a desired yield without a load to the environment. Consequently, soil P recommendation systems are widely used around the world to ensure good soil management and nutrient efficiency promoting agricultural sustainability. However recommendation systems differ considerably among countries. Not many systems can be found as peer reviewed literature; however a brief overview on those available is hereby given. Phosphorus recommendation systems are commonly used in Brazil, in a country where soils are generally nutrient poor. The Brazilian recommendation systems are based on quantitative analyses of soil input variables. The input variable consists of the following factors; cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), base sum, exchangeable aluminium (Al), calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg), potassium (K) and P levels, sodium (Na) saturation and electrical conductivity. The output variable of the system is the amount of fertilizer to be applied. This is mainly based on 4 classes, low, medium, high to very high (Palhares et al., 2001). While Brazil follows a detailed set of variables when recommending P fertilizer levels, the agronomists at Kansas University – who, among other land grant Universities in the United States, provide single rate recommendation for nutrients such as P – are developing a fertilizer recommendation system that gives growers the flexibility to choose a soil management practice suitable for their needs. This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the “nutrient sufficiency recommendation system” which is developed to provide a 90–95% maximum yield for the year, and the “build maintenance fertility program” based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4–8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003). In West Africa, a framework to optimize soil fertility management in rice production is in use were the yield potential is estimated by an ecophysiological model based on weather conditions, cultivar species and sowing date. This yield potential is used as an input into a static model together with field specific data such as recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous NPK supply and maximum NPK accumulation. Outputs of the framework include, required fertilizer doses to obtain different yield targets depending on yield potential and the soil nutrient supply (Haefele et al., 2003).",

As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

    "The situation for the 45° case is more interesting (Fig. 9). Here the release is in an intersection and the flow is oblique. In this snapshot, at z=0.23 H the whole plume is blown into the canyon region between the cubes in the y-direction and none in the x-direction. Note that the flow is constantly changing and that this is literally a snapshot. In a different snapshot this might of course be different and on average the plume would be equally likely to be blown into the gap in the x-direction. A little further up, at z=0.52 H, we see that much of the material is now caught in the wake region. A little still comes from the horizontal location of the original source. Higher still, at z=0.80 H, most of the material is concentrated in the region between the cubes. Nothing comes from the horizontal location of the original source. The highest concentration is around the centre of the gap, but somewhat away from the mean location of the core of the recirculation behind the upstream cube. This indicates the possible release of material trapped further down in the recirculation. These visualisations suggest the idea that transfer from the original source location to the wake occurs predominantly at low levels, whereas the re-release of material occurs mainly at higher levels. It would be of interest to test this hypothesis quantitatively in future studies. Above the array, material appears to be coming from the wake region, which therefore acts as a ‘secondary source’.",

Percentage colonisation by G. geosporum plus G. mosseae in combination appeared to be additive relative to that observed by the species individually (16.2%, G. geosporum; 9.9% G. mosseae).

First, participants responded to the self-administered 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at phases 3, 5, 7, and 9, a screening instrument designed for and widely used in population-based surveys and trials (26). Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27). In a more recent validation using a subgroup of 274 participants aged 58 to 70 in 2010, the sensitivity and specificity of GHQ symptom caseness against diagnosed depressive episodes based on a structured psychiatric interview were 80% and 81%, respectively.",

From high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, values for Au of eGB=(0.04–0.10)×10-10m (Ref. [22]) or eGB=0.12×10-10m (Ref. [23]) are reported. From measurements of the grain boundary contact angle in an Al tricrystal, a value eGB=0.64×10-10m is reported by Shvindlerman et al. [24] applying a thermodynamic model. For nanocrystalline Pd [25] and Fe [26], values of eGB=0.23×10-10m and 0.19×10-10m were determined from density measurements and modeling of grain growth kinetics, respectively. A number of computer simulations of grain boundaries [27–30] deal with the issue of grain boundary expansion. Here, however, the choice of the interatomic potentials was found to have a substantial influence on the numerical results [27]. Most recently, grain boundary expansion data have been reported from molecular dynamics simulations on Ni, eGB=(0.28–0.42)×10-10m for random high-angle grain boundaries [30] and eGB=(0.39–0.41)×10-10m (at T = 1200 K) for Σ5 grain boundaries [29].

Since the premise of the investigation was to quantify the relationship between biological richness and soil structural changes over time, the soils were not pre-incubated prior to the start of the experiment. Therefore, microbial communities were allowed to develop during the course of the 7 month experiment either in the presence of mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots, or in unplanted soil, thereby allowing root associated changes in community development to be measured. Others, for example Griffiths et al. (2001) and Wertz et al. (2006), incubated soils for 9 or 4.8 months respectively to allow microbial communities to develop a similar biomass before biodiversity/function relationships were studied.

The tensile yield stress is calculated from the measured compressive yield stress [39]. The addition of S-CSR particles reduces the compressive true yield stress, as expected, due to the relative softness of the polysiloxane rubber. The values decreased approximately linearly with increasing S-CSR particle content, see Fig. 4. At 20 °C, a value of 111 MPa was measured for the unmodified epoxy polymer, which also reveals that the unmodified epoxy should have the highest strength, if the effect of defects is excluded, when the test is conducted in uniaxial tension. The lowest value of the compressive true yield stress was measured to be 63 MPa for the 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymer.",

    "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

To reduce the probability of tip fracture during 3DAP evaporation of the atomic layers, we used field evaporation with a laser pulse instead of an electric field pulse. The 3DAP observation conditions were as follows: laser energy of 0.5–0.6 nJ, a laser-pulse repetition rate of 250 kHz, a DC bias voltage of 4–7 kV, and a specimen temperature of 55 K. The DC voltage was automatically controlled to keep a constant evaporation rate of 0.4% at constant energy of the laser pulse. The Ga+-irradiated regions by FIB around the top of the thinned tip were fractured before 3DAP observation at a DC voltage range of 2–4 kV. The computer program IVAS3.6.1 (Cameca Instruments Inc.) was used to analyze the data. Orientations of the screw dislocations were defined with high accuracy on the basis of {111} planes of stacking faults, which were observed while mapping the same atom.

As ηnet ranges from 0.1 to 1 (with the average solar flux), the velocity at the upper boundary increases from 2.6 km s−1 to 25 km s−1. However, the velocity does not increase linearly with stellar flux or without a bound – in the 100× case the velocity at the upper boundary is only 30 km s−1. An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With ηnet = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with ηnet = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3. Basically the sonic point, when it exists, moves further from the planet as the high altitude heating rate decreases.",

The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston).

    "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.",

    "The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere. Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.",

Thus our studies began by establishing a static suspension culture condition in E8 medium for serial passaging and expansion of hiPSCs. BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007). The cells survived and formed convex dish-shaped aggregates within 24 h due to the gravity force (Fig. 1a). The size of the cell aggregates gradually increased corresponding to the cell number along the culture period. BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7 ± 0.9 fold per passage, 3.7 × 106 fold increase in total with > 99% of the cells being TRA-1–60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c). We also examined the differentiation potential of expanded cells, using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008).

    "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.",

This corresponds to a peak of similar energy when the energy spectrum is plotted in PSD, but is not shown here. By comparing the energy spectrum of the electron feature to those from the different regions around Mars we find the origin is most likely from the solar wind. Comparing to the modelled Maxwellian distributions show the presence of an accelerated peak as well as an added contribution of heated electrons. This indicates the electron feature could be some way between penetrating solar wind and magnetosheath electrons. Evidence of electrons being accelerated and heated has been found in previous analysis of “inverted-V” electrons and is observed as preferably transverse to the magnetic field at low altitudes (Lundin et al., 2006b; Dubinin et al., 2009).",

The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of ∼0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest ⩽1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.",

    "We used three indicators (or proxy measures) to identify persons with depressive symptoms. First, participants responded to the self-administered 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at phases 3, 5, 7, and 9, a screening instrument designed for and widely used in population-based surveys and trials (26). Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27). In a more recent validation using a subgroup of 274 participants aged 58 to 70 in 2010, the sensitivity and specificity of GHQ symptom caseness against diagnosed depressive episodes based on a structured psychiatric interview were 80% and 81%, respectively.",

    "An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.",

Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C.

    "For cell differentiation, FAP-specific iPS cells were cultured with serial changes of media as shown in Fig. 3A. To test whether FAP-specific iPS cells can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, we analyzed several markers via real-time PCR analysis on Day 5 (D5), D13 and D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells (Fig. 3B). A decrease in expression of the pluripotency marker Oct3/4 was accompanied by differentiation of FAP-specific iPS cells. Expression of the endoderm marker Sox17 was observed on D5 differentiation and decreased gradually after the medium was changed to hepatic differentiation medium on D7 (Fig. 3B). The hepatic progenitor marker AFP and the mature hepatocyte marker ALB were obviously expressed on D13 and D20. In addition, immunocytochemical analyses showed Sox17 expression on D5, both HNF-4α and AFP expression on D13, and ALB cytoplasmic staining on D20 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative imaging analysis revealed that approximately 78 ± 0.6% of cells were Sox17-positive on D5 and approximately 88 ± 1.1% of cells were AFP-positive on D13 and approximately 29 ± 0.9% of cells were ALB-positive on D20 (Fig. 3D). The ALB secretion in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells on D20 was approximately 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3E). Moreover, these D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells were also periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, indicating cytoplasmic glycogen storage (Fig. 3F).

    "BC1 and TNC1 hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages were tested for their pluripotency by in vitro and in vivo differentiation methods. For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig. S4). After 8 days in spinner flask followed by 4 days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a). In contrast, undifferentiated hiPSCs on day 0 showed negative staining of all germ markers (data not shown). For in vivo assay, BC1 and TNC1 harvested from suspension culture in spinner flasks were injected into immune-deficient mice and were able to form teratomas containing cells of all germ layers, including glandular epithelium, chondrocytes, and neural rosettes (Fig. 5b). Directed hematopoietic differentiation potential was also tested as previously described (Fig. 5c).

DELLA proteins, which contain an N-terminal DELLA (asp-glu-leu-leu-ala) domain essential for GA-dependent proteasomal degradation, repress GA responses [28].

Similar to the previous example, an interpretation of this alignment is to divert the stream towards the corner of the ∨ where turbines can extract large amounts of power.

The time interval of the ELS spectrogram is 12 min, revealing a clear “inverted-V” structure over a 2-min interval at the centre of the spectrogram. The DEF energy spectrum at the right shows a positive gradient below the energy of the peak, which is at approximately 60 eV. This corresponds to a peak of similar energy when the energy spectrum is plotted in PSD, but is not shown here. By comparing the energy spectrum of the electron feature to those from the different regions around Mars we find the origin is most likely from the solar wind. Comparing to the modelled Maxwellian distributions show the presence of an accelerated peak as well as an added contribution of heated electrons. This indicates the electron feature could be some way between penetrating solar wind and magnetosheath electrons. Evidence of electrons being accelerated and heated has been found in previous analysis of “inverted-V” electrons and is observed as preferably transverse to the magnetic field at low altitudes (Lundin et al., 2006b; Dubinin et al., 2009).",

    "Three different methods were used to recover sediment cores in 2010. The upper 0.8 m of sediments were recovered using a freeze-coring technique (Renberg and Hansson, 1993). This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4). Sandy sediment was recovered in the bottom of GD4, equivalent to a sediment depth between 11.8 m and 11.5 m and it proved impossible to penetrate through this material with the available equipment.",

    "To deliberate the chirality of the supramolecular architecture, solid state circular dichroism spectra were measured in a KCl matrix for GMP ligand and the single-crystals of complex 1 (Fig. 3(b)). There is a red-shift in the solid state CD spectrum of GMP compared with its liquid CD spectrum. The negative band about the conformation of the sugar moiety has nearly disappeared. In solid-state, mutarotation is more difficult and the negative band at the 260 nm nearby can be detected which indicates that the GMP ligand is mainly β-anomers. In the spectrum of complex 1, the weak negative band at 215–225 nm indicates that the GMP exists as l-ribo [5], which is induced by the strong π–π and hydrogen bonding interaction. For solid samples, CD spectroscopy is highly sensitive to even a very small distortion from planarity of the aromatic chromophore [12]. The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.",

    "We found that the dense layers of brash produced by windrowing significantly reduced the amount of natural regeneration. Windrows could be up to a metre high and several metres wide, producing a physical barrier that prevented seedling establishment and creating regions with little or no regeneration. While we might expect seedlings from larger seeded species like rowan (200,000 seeds weigh 1 kg) to have an advantage over seedlings from smaller seeded species such as birch (5.9 million seeds weigh 1 kg) in growing through brash (Leishman and Westoby, 1994) we found no significant difference between the proportion of rowan in windrows and interrows. Furthermore, previous studies have found that where grazing pressure is high, brash (Truscott et al., 2004) and coarse woody debris (Smit et al., 2012) can help protect seedlings from browsing. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from our study as only a single site (U15) recorded significant browsing. The low incidence of browsing at our study sites (grazing pressure was controlled) means that grazing is unlikely to limit regeneration (Palmer et al., 2004; Olesen and Madsen, 2008; Yamagawa et al., 2010).",

    "The substellar tide is included in the C3 model. We included it mainly to compare our results with previous models (Garcia Munoz, 2007; Penz et al., 2008; Murray-Clay et al., 2009). The substellar tide is not a particularly good representation of the stellar tide in a globally averaged sense. In reality, including tides in the models is much more complicated than simply considering the substellar tide (e.g., Trammell et al., 2011). Compared to the C1 model, the maximum temperature in the C3 model is cooler by ∼1000 K and at high altitudes the C3 model is cooler by 1000–2000 K. The velocity is faster and hence adiabatic cooling is also more efficient. The substellar tide drives supersonic escape (see also, Penz et al., 2008) and the sonic point in the C3 model is at a much lower altitude than in the C1 model (see Section 3.1.3). However, it is not clear how the sonic point behaves as a function of latitude and longitude. Given that the tide is also likely to induce horizontal flows, it cannot be included accurately in 1D models.",

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3). Costaining of SC121 with an antibody to MCT1 and Ezrin, both apical membrane markers, further confirmed that the RPE were (still) polarized (Figure 3). SC121+ RPE transplants were negative for the expression of the cell-cycle marker ki67, the proliferation marker phosphohistone H3, and for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (Figures 3F–3H), indicating absence of proliferation and apoptosis. We estimated the total human RPE cell survival to be approximately 95% after 1 month by using the SC121 positivity; we measured the total length of the carrier and the length of SC121 stain and calculated the percent coverage of SC121 over the total carrier length. On transmission electron micrography (TEM), polarized RPE cells were observed on the PET carriers from both fetal and adult transplants (Figures 3I and 3J). These results confirm survival of polarized human RPE from fetal and adult donors xenografted into rabbit SRS over 4 weeks.",

    "The 3DAP observations were performed using a Cameca Instruments Inc. laser-assisted local electrode 3DAP (LEAP-3000XHR). To reduce the probability of tip fracture during 3DAP evaporation of the atomic layers, we used field evaporation with a laser pulse instead of an electric field pulse. The 3DAP observation conditions were as follows: laser energy of 0.5–0.6 nJ, a laser-pulse repetition rate of 250 kHz, a DC bias voltage of 4–7 kV, and a specimen temperature of 55 K. The DC voltage was automatically controlled to keep a constant evaporation rate of 0.4% at constant energy of the laser pulse. The Ga+-irradiated regions by FIB around the top of the thinned tip were fractured before 3DAP observation at a DC voltage range of 2–4 kV. The computer program IVAS3.6.1 (Cameca Instruments Inc.) was used to analyze the data. Orientations of the screw dislocations were defined with high accuracy on the basis of {111} planes of stacking faults, which were observed while mapping the same atom. Details of the methods were explained in our previous paper [7].",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

    "An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.",

    "To deliberate the chirality of the supramolecular architecture, solid state circular dichroism spectra were measured in a KCl matrix for GMP ligand and the single-crystals of complex 1 (Fig. 3(b)). There is a red-shift in the solid state CD spectrum of GMP compared with its liquid CD spectrum. The negative band about the conformation of the sugar moiety has nearly disappeared. In solid-state, mutarotation is more difficult and the negative band at the 260 nm nearby can be detected which indicates that the GMP ligand is mainly β-anomers. In the spectrum of complex 1, the weak negative band at 215–225 nm indicates that the GMP exists as l-ribo [5], which is induced by the strong π–π and hydrogen bonding interaction. For solid samples, CD spectroscopy is highly sensitive to even a very small distortion from planarity of the aromatic chromophore [12]. The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.",

The values decreased approximately linearly with increasing S-CSR particle content, see Fig. 4. At 20 °C, a value of 111 MPa was measured for the unmodified epoxy polymer, which also reveals that the unmodified epoxy should have the highest strength, if the effect of defects is excluded, when the test is conducted in uniaxial tension.

In the mid-term there is the Staebler–Wronski effect for a-Si [48,49] or pre-conditioning for CIGS, which affects the annual energy prediction by less than 5% typically and are not further explored here. The effect for CIGS is slightly contradictory as there is no clarity of the time scales involved yet [4,50]. There are also long-term gradual degradation effects which affect all device technologies [51]. In many published discussions there are generalisations of technologies. It is shown below that such a general behaviour was not observed at CREST. The maximum power point data of all devices within an irradiance range of 650–750 W/m2 have been extracted and corrected to 700 W/m2 and 25 °C using bi-linear interpolation. These power values are annotated as P700. This particular irradiance level was chosen as there is a statistically significant number of data points in each month of the year and thus fewer outliers to affect the analysis.

All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use.

In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

    "We have shown that inverted BHJ devices made with rapidly grown ZnO hole blocking layers using atmospheric atomic layer deposition (AALD) give device performances that are comparable with the best inverted P3HT:PCBM BHJ devices reported to date. Working devices with good, but lower performance were obtained without any post-annealing of the as-grown AALD ZnO. On the other hand, these unannealed AALD ZnO films are suitable for making flexible, plastic substrate solar cells. A compromise between device performance and suitability for making plastic substrate solar cells was achieved by post-annealing the ZnO films at 150 °C. The AALD ZnO fulfils the properties required for good hole blocking layers: the films are compact, have a high electron mobility, have up to 100% visible light transmittance, good blend wettability and very good device stability over time. In addition, the deposition process occurs under atmospheric conditions and has the potential to be implemented in a roll-to-roll process. AALD ZnO films are therefore highly suited as multifunctional components for inverted BHJ devices.",

    "We found that the dense layers of brash produced by windrowing significantly reduced the amount of natural regeneration. Windrows could be up to a metre high and several metres wide, producing a physical barrier that prevented seedling establishment and creating regions with little or no regeneration. While we might expect seedlings from larger seeded species like rowan (200,000 seeds weigh 1 kg) to have an advantage over seedlings from smaller seeded species such as birch (5.9 million seeds weigh 1 kg) in growing through brash (Leishman and Westoby, 1994) we found no significant difference between the proportion of rowan in windrows and interrows. Furthermore, previous studies have found that where grazing pressure is high, brash (Truscott et al., 2004) and coarse woody debris (Smit et al., 2012) can help protect seedlings from browsing. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from our study as only a single site (U15) recorded significant browsing. The low incidence of browsing at our study sites (grazing pressure was controlled) means that grazing is unlikely to limit regeneration (Palmer et al., 2004; Olesen and Madsen, 2008; Yamagawa et al., 2010).",

Human cells were identified based on GFP expression and use of human specific antibodies against cytoplasmic antigen (hCA). Two days after in ovo transplantation, surviving GFP+ cells were found dispersed in the area of the endogenous chick trigeminal ganglion (Figure 4P). We observed extensive GFP+ human fiber bundles coexpressing hCA and peripherin (Figures 4Q and 4R). In contrast, no hCA or peripherin expression was detected in the neural tube of the embryo (Figure S5D).

    "Regeneration of oak and rowan was found to be significantly clumped although not significantly dependent on distance from the seed source. Rowan is primarily dispersed through ingestion by birds, particularly various thrush species (Raspe et al., 2000), while oak relies on hoarding by both birds and mammals but especially Garrulus glandarius (jay) and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse) (Forget et al., 2004), both of which occur at the study sites. The distribution of regenerating saplings will therefore be partly controlled by the behaviour of the dispersing animal. Previous work in central Europe has demonstrated that the majority of oak regeneration occurs within 100 m of a seed source and declines rapidly at greater distances (Mirschel et al., 2011). However, our findings are in contrast to previous work carried out in lowland sites in the UK that found positive relationships between the number of oak seedlings and distance to parent trees but no significant effect for birch seedlings (Harmer et al., 2005), possibly indicating differences between the shelterwood examined by Harmer et al.

    "KSS is a multisystem disorder defined clinically by the triad of PEO and pigmentary retinopathy with onset before the age of 20 years plus at least one of: cardiac conduction block; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration greater than 0.1 g/L; cerebellar ataxia [76–80]. Frequent additional signs include sensorineural hearing loss, renal tubular acidosis, dementia, seizures, short stature and endocrine disturbance (diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism and growth hormone deficiency). A progressive skeletal myopathy is also frequently seen. The most common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with bilateral, often symmetrical, hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter, thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstem [81–83]. Interestingly, there appears to be little correlation between neurological deficits and the severity of the MRI features [84]. KSS is most commonly associated with single large-scale deletions of mtDNA [56]. We recently identified a case of KSS caused by nuclear genomic dysfunction due to mutations in RRM2B in a patient with multiple deletions of the mtDNA [85]. It is, therefore, possible for KSS to follow a Mendelian pattern of inheritance, although the majority of cases are sporadic.",

    "To obtain a relatively stable substrate during the measurements, all iron substrates were pre-conditioned in a 10 wt.% NaOH solution overnight to form a thin oxidized surface layer, followed by rinsing with 99.5% pure ethanol and drying with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas prior to use. The alkaline treatment of the iron surface results in formation of hematite (α-Fe2O3), which will be shown and discussed in relation to Fig. 9. The hematite surface contains different types of surface hydroxyl groups that differ by their coordination to the substrate [26]. The hematite surface is amphoteric due to the possibility of protonization and deprotonization of the surface hydroxyl groups. In neutral solution, the ξ-potential has been found to be slightly positive [27,28]. The water contact angle on our hematite surface is 69 ± 3°, and the open circuit potential relative to Ag/AgCl is −0.72 V, which is similar to that of iron due to the small thickness of the oxide layer.",

This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4). Sandy sediment was recovered in the bottom of GD4, equivalent to a sediment depth between 11.8 m and 11.5 m and it proved impossible to penetrate through this material with the available equipment.",

In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression.

    "It is important to note that the divalent cation Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.097 nm [22], which leads to a number of speculative points; (1) the diameter of the cation is smaller than the internal cavity of the amylose helix (double or single; ca. 0.4–1.0 nm), which itself is presumably flexible under the synthesis conditions to accommodate introduction of the Cd2+ into its hydrophobic cavity (perhaps occupying micropores (Table 1); (2) the diameter is also approximately the same length as the (OH) H-bonding distances (i.e. 0.19–0.21 nm) [23] between adjacent glucose residues that form the amylose helix (believed to be key to the formation of the porous polysaccharide phase); [15,24] consequently coordination of Cd2+ may stabilise an alternative metastable polysaccharide confirmation(s), gel state and in turn expanded surface properties. It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase. CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or “seeds” (as indicated from XRD data). As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase. As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase. This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.",

At altitudes higher than this, collisions with H+ are more frequent.

The mass loss rate in our models is Ṁ>107kgs-1 and thus O is dragged along to high altitudes by H. On the other hand, collisions with H+ dominate the transport of heavy ions such as Si+ as long as the ratio [H+]/[H] ≳ 10−4 (Paper II). This explains why Coulomb collisions in our models are more frequent than heavy ion–H collisions at almost all altitudes apart from the immediate vicinity of the lower boundary.

    "It is possible to explain such observations in general if we consider MEX to be above a region that has accelerated electrons upwards, in which case heavy-ions could also be accelerated downwards. This may explain the appearance of the very low DEF of heavy-ions at ∼400eV. However, due to the finite gyro-radius effect it is also plausible that the general behaviour of the heavy-ions flowing away from Mars may not change, even when passing an acceleration region. The gyroradius of heavy-ions with energies around ∼10eV at the location of the accelerated electron signature is around 100 km, which is of a similar spatial scale to the horizontal size of a closed crustal magnetic field line at 400 km. Therefore, it is possible the heavy-ions do not remain in the acceleration region long enough to experience its effects.",

    "An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.",

    "S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae are the most common pathogens implicated in OME, and all are capable of forming biofilms [33,42]. However, rather than focusing just on those three bacteria, this study cultured effusions on a wide range of different media for prolonged time periods in order to capture as many isolates as possible. Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp. and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study. CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43]. S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45]. Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47]. Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe that inhabits the mouth and upper respiratory tract, forms biofilms [48] and has previously been found in middle ear disease [49,50]. S. aureus also forms biofilms and has been identified in middle ear disease [51,52]. Although most of the bacteria in Table 2 have previously been isolated in middle ear disease, to the best of the authors’ knowledge Flavimonas oryzihabitans, Vibrio metschnikovii and Gemella haemolysans have not been implicated previously.",

The resulting difference between the scenarios in Vp is less than 5 m/s. Considering the uncertainties (e.g. ±5% error in CO2 saturation) in the petrophysical experiments (Kummerow and Spangenberg, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2012) corresponding to ±70 m/s in Vp (Fig. 5), we did not take into account the Vp changes (Fig. 5, Eq.

    "It has not been reported whether the significantly simplified E8 medium is sufficient to support the survival and proliferation of undifferentiated hPSCs in suspension culture. Thus our studies began by establishing a static suspension culture condition in E8 medium for serial passaging and expansion of hiPSCs. BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007). The cells survived and formed convex dish-shaped aggregates within 24 h due to the gravity force (Fig. 1a). The size of the cell aggregates gradually increased corresponding to the cell number along the culture period. BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7 ± 0.9 fold per passage, 3.7 × 106 fold increase in total with > 99% of the cells being TRA-1–60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c). We also examined the differentiation potential of expanded cells, using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008). We found that under the hematopoiesis-inducing condition, leukocyte-like cells emerged around day 10 (Fig. 1d) with 46.8% ± 1.6% of the cells becoming CD34+CD45+ HPCs (Fig. 1e). These results indicate that undifferentiated hiPSCs can be expanded in suspension in E8 medium supplemented with one-day treatment of Y27632, and retain their differentiation potential.",

    "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS = 60,268 km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn’s inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

    "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5–10 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.",

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

The alkaline treatment of the iron surface results in formation of hematite (α-Fe2O3), which will be shown and discussed in relation to Fig. 9. The hematite surface contains different types of surface hydroxyl groups that differ by their coordination to the substrate [26]. The hematite surface is amphoteric due to the possibility of protonization and deprotonization of the surface hydroxyl groups. In neutral solution, the ξ-potential has been found to be slightly positive [27,28]. The water contact angle on our hematite surface is 69 ± 3°, and the open circuit potential relative to Ag/AgCl is −0.72 V, which is similar to that of iron due to the small thickness of the oxide layer.",

    "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.",

The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).",

    "Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.",

    "Over-expression of master regulators for cold tolerance can produce cold-tolerant leaves and photosynthetic apparatus, including tolerance to photoinhibition in winter. Over-expression of two endogenous cold-binding factor/drought responsive element binding (CBF/DREB)1-like genes in rape (B. napus) increased freezing tolerance and improved photochemical efficiency and photosynthetic capacity. These transgenics were less affected by photoinhibition induced by low temperatures and high insolation [99]. Similarly, over-expression of two CBF/DREB genes from Eucalyptus gunnii, a species that can withstand winter temperatures down to −18 °C, improved drought and freezing tolerance of a cold-sensitive Eucalyptus hybrid (E. urophylla × E. grandis) [136]. Tropical E. grandis × E. urophylla expressing a stress-inducible rd29a promoter-CBF2 transcription factor cassette demonstrated stable tolerance to −8 °C in a variety of locations through multiple years with no significant loss in productivity [130].",

    "For Na, Al, K and Fe, the lowest bed inventory of 4.5 kg resulted in a concentration in the flue gas which was less than that of the blank sample, values which then increased for the higher bed inventories. This suggests that a certain amount of these elements is being absorbed, perhaps by the sorbent in the case of Fe, or by the reactor itself. In the case of P, decreased values compared to the blank were found for bed inventories of 4.5 kg and 13 kg, but an increased value for 6 kg inventory. However, the values are very low at <0.01 ppm and this anomalous result may be due to analytical errors. Overall, although concentrations in the flue gas are small at <2 ppm, increasing bed inventory does appear to increase the concentration of the majority of major elements present in the flue gas.",

    "A total of 71 palynology samples were prepared at the British Geological Survey using standard preparation procedures (Moore et al., 1991). Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C. Foraminifera samples between 20 and 60 g of dried sediment were processed by washing through a 63 μm sieve with water. All specimens were counted and converted to foraminifera/g (Table S2).

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

    "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.",

    "The sulfate deposition flux produced in the nominal model is compatible with estimates of the amount of sulfates on Mars. The nominal range (1.0–1.7 wt.% SO4) is consistent with 1.3 wt.% soluble sulfate measured at the Phoenix landing site (Kounaves et al., 2010b). The estimates also compare well with an average ∼6.8 wt.% sulfur as SO3 (2.7 wt.% S) in global soil inferred from elemental abundances measured at various locations on Mars by Spirit, Opportunity, Pathfinder, and Viking Landers. We can also compare the average sulfur content in the top few tens of centimeters of the soil of ∼4.4 wt.% inferred from Gamma Ray Spectrometer measurements (King and McLennan, 2010). The agreement between model results and data suggest that 0.1% of the terrestrial volcanic gas flux is a good estimate for the volcanic emission rate on Mars 1–2 Ga if soil salts derive from volcanic input.",

The values decreased approximately linearly with increasing S-CSR particle content, see Fig. 4. At 20 °C, a value of 111 MPa was measured for the unmodified epoxy polymer, which also reveals that the unmodified epoxy should have the highest strength, if the effect of defects is excluded, when the test is conducted in uniaxial tension.

These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively.

The deposition velocity is coupled to the gas concentrations computed by chemical kinetics. Following Zahnle et al.

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level.

    "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.",

    "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5–10 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.",

    "The cutoff level of the empirical model is somewhat arbitrary. For neutral species it is partly based on ionization (K10), but this criterion obviously does not apply to ions. With a cutoff level at 5Rp for the ions only, the M7 model yields line-integrated transit depths of 3.9%, 8%, and 5.8% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively, if 40% of silicon is Si2+. These values agree with the observed values to better than 2σ. Similarly, by extending the cutoff level of the C2 model to 5Rp, we obtained transit depths of 3.2%, 6.7%, and 4.6% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively (see Table 2). These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively. The transit depths predicted by the M7 model are higher partly because the mean temperature of 8250 K is higher than the corresponding temperature in the C2 model (Paper I).

    "BC1 and TNC1 hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages were tested for their pluripotency by in vitro and in vivo differentiation methods. For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig. S4). After 8 days in spinner flask followed by 4 days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a). In contrast, undifferentiated hiPSCs on day 0 showed negative staining of all germ markers (data not shown). For in vivo assay, BC1 and TNC1 harvested from suspension culture in spinner flasks were injected into immune-deficient mice and were able to form teratomas containing cells of all germ layers, including glandular epithelium, chondrocytes, and neural rosettes (Fig. 5b). Directed hematopoietic differentiation potential was also tested as previously described (Fig. 5c). Differentiating BC1 and TNC1 cells contained 43.57% ± 4.35% (n = 3) and 43.22% ± 7.13% (n = 3) CD34+CD45+ HPCs on day 14 of differentiation, respectively. The CFU assay measuring hematopoietic progenitors showed that hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks were able to generate colonies of different hematopoietic cell lineages.

    "The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere. Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.",

To test whether FAP-specific iPS cells can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, we analyzed several markers via real-time PCR analysis on Day 5 (D5), D13 and D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells (Fig. 3B). A decrease in expression of the pluripotency marker Oct3/4 was accompanied by differentiation of FAP-specific iPS cells. Expression of the endoderm marker Sox17 was observed on D5 differentiation and decreased gradually after the medium was changed to hepatic differentiation medium on D7 (Fig. 3B). The hepatic progenitor marker AFP and the mature hepatocyte marker ALB were obviously expressed on D13 and D20. In addition, immunocytochemical analyses showed Sox17 expression on D5, both HNF-4α and AFP expression on D13, and ALB cytoplasmic staining on D20 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative imaging analysis revealed that approximately 78 ± 0.6% of cells were Sox17-positive on D5 and approximately 88 ± 1.1% of cells were AFP-positive on D13 and approximately 29 ± 0.9% of cells were ALB-positive on D20 (Fig. 3D). The ALB secretion in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells on D20 was approximately 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3E). Moreover, these D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells were also periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, indicating cytoplasmic glycogen storage (Fig. 3F). These results clearly indicated that FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells.",

    "In upland areas of Great Britain, large tracts of non-native conifer plantations have been established on poor quality agricultural land. There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species. We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120 m to 380 m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers. Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000 stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations. Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

    "All analyses were carried out at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory. C and N analyses (from which we present weight % C/N) were performed on 225 samples by combustion in a Costech ECS4010 Elemental Analyser (EA) calibrated against an acetanilide standard (Table S3). C/N atomic ratios were calculated by multiplying by 1.167. Replicate analysis of well-mixed samples indicated a precision of ±<0.1. Carbon isotope analysis was carried out on 289 bulk rock samples (Table S4) after removing migrated hydrocarbons (Stephenson et al., 2005). The hydrocarbons were removed by crushing the rock fragments using a ball mill, and the soluble organic matter from all rock samples was extracted using a Soxhlet extractor. The samples were refluxed for 24 h in an azeotropic mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (93:7, v/v). All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use. Any remaining solvent was then removed by evaporation and the dried sediments were transferred to vials. Any calcites (shelly fragments) were removed by placing the samples in 5% HCl overnight before rinsing and drying down. Carbon isotope analysis was also carried out on palynology residues of the >250 μm size fractions dominated by AOM. 13C/12C analyses were performed on 35 samples by combustion in a Costech Elemental Analyser (EA) online to a VG TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer, with δ13C values calculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standards calibrated against NBS-18, NBS-19, and NBS-22. Replicate 13C/12C analyses were carried out on the section, and the mean standard deviation on the replicate analyses is 0.4‰.",

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

Temporary graft encapsulation with thermosensitive gelatin and/or plasmin-assisted vitrectomy, however, was found to cause more aggressive retinal destruction and choroidal engorgement on SD-OCT compared to unaided implantation of fetal hRPE/PET implants (Figure S2). In contrast, we found that all these negative effects were ameliorated through 1 to 2 mg intravitreal triamcinolone (TCA) injection at the end of the surgery.

    "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS = 60,268 km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn’s inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

The mean difference between the two instruments remains fairly constant, with the lidar overestimating the wind speed by between 0 and 0.5 m s−1. At wind speeds greater than 20 m s−1 the lidar appears to be overestimating the wind speed.

As ηnet ranges from 0.1 to 1 (with the average solar flux), the velocity at the upper boundary increases from 2.6 km s−1 to 25 km s−1. However, the velocity does not increase linearly with stellar flux or without a bound – in the 100× case the velocity at the upper boundary is only 30 km s−1. An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With ηnet = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with ηnet = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3.

The line style code and labels are the same as in Fig. 6(a), the latitudinal size of a HST ACS-SBC pixel is indicated by the dark grey rectangle and the grey solid line indicates the limit of present HST detectability (~1kR; Cowley et al., 2007). We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF. However, this region is strongly dependent on the plasma flow model used and poorly constrained by observations.",

    "As coherent clusters are composed of both backward and forward slices, the stability of the backward slice profile itself does not guarantee the stability of coherent cluster profile. The remainder of this section looks at how the clustering profile is affected by bug fixes. Fig. 20 shows individual SCGs for each version of barcode. As coherent clusters are dependent on both backward and forward slices, such clusters will be more sensitive to changes in dependences within the program. The SCGs show that from the initial version barcode-0.90 there were two coherent clusters in the system. The smaller one is around 10% of the code while the larger is around 40% of the code. As the system evolved and went through various modifications and enhancements, the number of clusters and the profile of the clusters remained consistent other than its scaled growth with the increase in program size. It is also evident that during evolution of the system, the enhancement code or newly added code formed part of the larger cluster. This is why in the later stages of the evolution we see an increase in the size of the largest cluster, but not the smaller one.",

We can also compare the average sulfur content in the top few tens of centimeters of the soil of ∼4.4 wt.% inferred from Gamma Ray Spectrometer measurements (King and McLennan, 2010).

Core 22/10a-4 is located in the central part of the basin (Figs. 1 and S1) and is therefore disconnected from many marginal marine processes that could mask oceanographic signals (e.g. tidal or storm-induced erosion and slumping).

However using a number of paleoecologic micropaleontology methods together (Gillmore et al., 2001), along with 2D structural restoration (Kjennerud and Sylta, 2001), broad agreement was found and central parts of the northern North Sea appear to have had paleodepths of >0.5 km in the earliest Eocene near 22/10a-4 (Kjennerud and Gillmore, 2003, Fig. S1).",

    "A total of 71 palynology samples were prepared at the British Geological Survey using standard preparation procedures (Moore et al., 1991). Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C. Foraminifera samples between 20 and 60 g of dried sediment were processed by washing through a 63 μm sieve with water. All specimens were counted and converted to foraminifera/g (Table S2).

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

From measurements of the grain boundary contact angle in an Al tricrystal, a value eGB=0.64×10-10m is reported by Shvindlerman et al. [24] applying a thermodynamic model. For nanocrystalline Pd [25] and Fe [26], values of eGB=0.23×10-10m and 0.19×10-10m were determined from density measurements and modeling of grain growth kinetics, respectively. A number of computer simulations of grain boundaries [27–30] deal with the issue of grain boundary expansion. Here, however, the choice of the interatomic potentials was found to have a substantial influence on the numerical results [27].

    "An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.",

Microscopic inspection revealed that the grafts had been maintained as a largely intact and continuous cell monolayer. A positive pan-cytokeratin (pCK) signal, an established RPE marker, was confirmed for fetal and adult hRPE monolayers (Figures 3A and 3C). Additional pCK reactivity was seen “underneath” the cell carrier, likely from host RPE. Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3). Costaining of SC121 with an antibody to MCT1 and Ezrin, both apical membrane markers, further confirmed that the RPE were (still) polarized (Figure 3). SC121+ RPE transplants were negative for the expression of the cell-cycle marker ki67, the proliferation marker phosphohistone H3, and for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (Figures 3F–3H), indicating absence of proliferation and apoptosis. We estimated the total human RPE cell survival to be approximately 95% after 1 month by using the SC121 positivity; we measured the total length of the carrier and the length of SC121 stain and calculated the percent coverage of SC121 over the total carrier length. On transmission electron micrography (TEM), polarized RPE cells were observed on the PET carriers from both fetal and adult transplants (Figures 3I and 3J).

In this snapshot, at z=0.23 H the whole plume is blown into the canyon region between the cubes in the y-direction and none in the x-direction. Note that the flow is constantly changing and that this is literally a snapshot. In a different snapshot this might of course be different and on average the plume would be equally likely to be blown into the gap in the x-direction. A little further up, at z=0.52 H, we see that much of the material is now caught in the wake region. A little still comes from the horizontal location of the original source. Higher still, at z=0.80 H, most of the material is concentrated in the region between the cubes. Nothing comes from the horizontal location of the original source. The highest concentration is around the centre of the gap, but somewhat away from the mean location of the core of the recirculation behind the upstream cube. This indicates the possible release of material trapped further down in the recirculation. These visualisations suggest the idea that transfer from the original source location to the wake occurs predominantly at low levels, whereas the re-release of material occurs mainly at higher levels. It would be of interest to test this hypothesis quantitatively in future studies. Above the array, material appears to be coming from the wake region, which therefore acts as a ‘secondary source’.",

    "A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described. This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid. The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.",

    "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (∼33.7 Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive. Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.",

    "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.",

The similarity of results from different methods gives us confidence that the underlying trend is robust: the decline in load factor with age is neither an artefact of systematic variation in wind speeds nor of the continual improvement in technology.

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women). Since the phase 1 medical examination, follow-up examinations have taken place approximately every 5 years: phase 3 (1991 to 1993, n = 8815); phase 5 (1997 to 1999, n = 7870); phase 7 (2003 to 2004, n = 6967); and phase 9 (2008 to 2009, n = 6761). Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here.

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

    "The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 ± 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of ∼0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest ⩽1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.",

Previous work established the existence of coherent dependence clusters and detailed the functionalities of the visualization tool. This paper extends previous work in many ways, firstly by introducing an efficient hashing algorithm for slice approximation. This improves on the precision of previous slice approximation from 78% to 95%, resulting in precise and accurate clustering. The coherent cluster existence study is extended to empirically validate the results by considering 30 production programs. Additional case studies show that coherent clusters can help reveal the structure of a program and identify structural defects. We also introduce the notion of inter-cluster dependence which will form the base of reverse engineering efforts in future. Finally, we also present studies which show the lack of correlation between coherent clusters and bug fixes and show that coherent clusters remain surprisingly stable during system evolution.",

The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).",

However, rather than focusing just on those three bacteria, this study cultured effusions on a wide range of different media for prolonged time periods in order to capture as many isolates as possible. Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp. and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study. CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43]. S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45]. Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47]. Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe that inhabits the mouth and upper respiratory tract, forms biofilms [48] and has previously been found in middle ear disease [49,50].

This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4). Sandy sediment was recovered in the bottom of GD4, equivalent to a sediment depth between 11.8 m and 11.5 m and it proved impossible to penetrate through this material with the available equipment.",

    "To obtain a relatively stable substrate during the measurements, all iron substrates were pre-conditioned in a 10 wt.% NaOH solution overnight to form a thin oxidized surface layer, followed by rinsing with 99.5% pure ethanol and drying with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas prior to use. The alkaline treatment of the iron surface results in formation of hematite (α-Fe2O3), which will be shown and discussed in relation to Fig. 9. The hematite surface contains different types of surface hydroxyl groups that differ by their coordination to the substrate [26]. The hematite surface is amphoteric due to the possibility of protonization and deprotonization of the surface hydroxyl groups. In neutral solution, the ξ-potential has been found to be slightly positive [27,28]. The water contact angle on our hematite surface is 69 ± 3°, and the open circuit potential relative to Ag/AgCl is −0.72 V, which is similar to that of iron due to the small thickness of the oxide layer.",

    "The results in Table 3 indicate that when there is no attack RED has no obvious influence on the normal TCP flows (ρna and rna are almost the same for DropTail and RED). However, when LDDoS attacks are present, RED significantly improves the throughput of normal TCP. Note that in this case, RED drops 25% packets, much more than the 7.6% from DropTail. In other words, when the aggregate rate of the LDDoS flows is very close to the bottleneck bandwidth of network, deploying RED is able to drop more attack packets while increasing the throughput of the normal TCP flows. Admittedly RED might also drop more legitimate packets than DropTail here, however it achieves a higher normal-TCP-flow throughput ρa than DropTail. The throughput ρa of normal TCP flows is considered to be more important than its drop ratio ra when a network is under an LDDoS attack.",

    "In the present study, both aggregate stability and repellency were reduced in month 7; specifically the degree of reduction in repellency was less in the mycorrhizal soils than in the non-mycorrhizal soils. In the mycorrhizal soils, aggregate water repellency was also negatively correlated with bacterial (and fungal) TRF richness but positively correlated with root size and microbial biomass-C. It is likely that mycorrhizal hyphae contributed to the microbial biomass-C measured here which might explain why microbial biomass-C was not a factor in the model explaining repellency in the NM soils. In the mycorrhizal soils the relationship between microbial biomass-C and aggregate stability was negative, whilst it was positive for repellency. The GLM regressions used data for all 7 months but the system was dynamic across the months. For example, aggregate stability was greater in the mycorrhizal soils in month 3, yet repellency increased in months 5 and 7. The positive relationship observed between per cent root length colonised and microbial biomass-C is likely to be the result of increasing hyphal length in the soil, or possibly an enhancement of other microbial species too, since internal AMF root colonisation may not reflect the extraradical hyphal biomass. Aggregate turnover rates range from 4 to 88 days (De Gryze et al. 2005, 2006); an increase in aggregate stability observed here over a 60 day period (from the first to third month harvest) and an increase in aggregate water repellency over a 120 day period (from the first to fifth month harvest) is comparable to that observed by others.",

    "A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described. This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid. The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.",

    "In sequential PET studies, we observed increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 in one allograft (animal No. 10) at 3 months (Figures 3A and 3B). We could not detect any apparent uptake in the other animals or at any other time points (Figure S2). Intriguingly, the serum level of IFN-γ temporarily increased at 2 months after the transplant in three animals (Figure 3C). An immunofluorescence study conducted at 3.5–4 months showed that MHC-II+ cells were more frequently found in allografts than in autografts, especially in the monkey with increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 (Figure 3D, No. 10). The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells. An immunofluorescence study revealed that more CD45+ cells (a marker for pan-leukocytes) accumulated in allografts compared with autografts (Figures 3I and 3J). Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).

    "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.",

    "In order to determine whether the MRPL12 mutation also induced changes in composition and assembly of the mitochondrial ribosomal large and small subunits, mitochondrial lysates from cultured fibroblasts (subject and control) were fractionated on isokinetic sucrose gradients (10–30%, as in Ref. [47]). If assembly of either the large subunit or the entire ribosome was affected then the distribution of individual ribosomal proteins would change within the gradient profile. On analysis MRPL12 from the patient was substantially decreased in all fractions but detectable in the fractions consistent with mt-LSU; however it was noticeably absent from the free pool (fractions 1 and 2, Fig. 5). This was in contrast to the control that exhibited a pool of free MRPL12, which has been reported to interact with POLRMT [56]. MRPL3 was also slightly reduced in subject cells but remained in fractions consistent with the large subunit. The MRPL12 mutation impacted more modestly on the small ribosomal subunit, with DAP3 apparently unaffected and MRPS18B found in lower amounts only in fractions 4 and 5 but otherwise with similar steady state levels and distribution profile compared to control. Since POLRMT and MRPL12 have been published as interactors, we analyzed both the steady state level and gradient distribution of POLRMT to see if these were affected by the MRPL12 mutation. Overall levels in the subject sample were decreased to 63% of control value (Fig. 5B) but distribution in the gradient appeared largely unaffected with the exception of fraction 11, where levels were lower than control (Fig. 5A bottom panels).",

    "Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.",

The 3DAP observation conditions were as follows: laser energy of 0.5–0.6 nJ, a laser-pulse repetition rate of 250 kHz, a DC bias voltage of 4–7 kV, and a specimen temperature of 55 K. The DC voltage was automatically controlled to keep a constant evaporation rate of 0.4% at constant energy of the laser pulse.

According to the experimental results as shown in Table 9 and Fig. 4, we find that the computational time of both static (Algorithm 1) and incremental (Algorithm 3) algorithms are increasing monotonically along with the increasing of insert ratios. It is easy to get the incremental algorithm is always faster than the static algorithm when the inserting ratio increases from 10% to 100% according to Fig. 4(a)–(e).

The alkaline treatment of the iron surface results in formation of hematite (α-Fe2O3), which will be shown and discussed in relation to Fig. 9. The hematite surface contains different types of surface hydroxyl groups that differ by their coordination to the substrate [26]. The hematite surface is amphoteric due to the possibility of protonization and deprotonization of the surface hydroxyl groups. In neutral solution, the ξ-potential has been found to be slightly positive [27,28]. The water contact angle on our hematite surface is 69 ± 3°, and the open circuit potential relative to Ag/AgCl is −0.72 V, which is similar to that of iron due to the small thickness of the oxide layer.",

We could not detect any apparent uptake in the other animals or at any other time points (Figure S2). Intriguingly, the serum level of IFN-γ temporarily increased at 2 months after the transplant in three animals (Figure 3C). An immunofluorescence study conducted at 3.5–4 months showed that MHC-II+ cells were more frequently found in allografts than in autografts, especially in the monkey with increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 (Figure 3D, No. 10). The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells. An immunofluorescence study revealed that more CD45+ cells (a marker for pan-leukocytes) accumulated in allografts compared with autografts (Figures 3I and 3J). Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured by precipitating non-HDL cholesterol with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride using a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant.

    "An energy-based criterion was used to predict debonding of the particles. The method used has been fully described elsewhere [49] and essentially it proposes that the criterion for debonding is based upon the energy released by the debonding process. To obtain the parameters needed for this energy-based criterion, a finite-element analysis modelling study has been used to derive the change in strain-energy arising from the cavitation process, with the addition of the strain-energy stored in the particle prior to debonding. The applied stress used for these simulations was derived from experimental observations. Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size. It has therefore been assumed that the debonding takes place at an applied uniaxial stress of about 70 MPa, which equates to a hydrostatic stress at the crack tip of about 210 MPa. Thus, the finite-element analysis simulations were analysed for an applied hydrostatic stress of 210 MPa.",

As ηnet ranges from 0.1 to 1 (with the average solar flux), the velocity at the upper boundary increases from 2.6 km s−1 to 25 km s−1. However, the velocity does not increase linearly with stellar flux or without a bound – in the 100× case the velocity at the upper boundary is only 30 km s−1. An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With ηnet = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with ηnet = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3.

We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF.

In this snapshot, at z=0.23 H the whole plume is blown into the canyon region between the cubes in the y-direction and none in the x-direction. Note that the flow is constantly changing and that this is literally a snapshot. In a different snapshot this might of course be different and on average the plume would be equally likely to be blown into the gap in the x-direction. A little further up, at z=0.52 H, we see that much of the material is now caught in the wake region. A little still comes from the horizontal location of the original source. Higher still, at z=0.80 H, most of the material is concentrated in the region between the cubes. Nothing comes from the horizontal location of the original source. The highest concentration is around the centre of the gap, but somewhat away from the mean location of the core of the recirculation behind the upstream cube. This indicates the possible release of material trapped further down in the recirculation. These visualisations suggest the idea that transfer from the original source location to the wake occurs predominantly at low levels, whereas the re-release of material occurs mainly at higher levels. It would be of interest to test this hypothesis quantitatively in future studies. Above the array, material appears to be coming from the wake region, which therefore acts as a ‘secondary source’.",

    "It is important to note that the divalent cation Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.097 nm [22], which leads to a number of speculative points; (1) the diameter of the cation is smaller than the internal cavity of the amylose helix (double or single; ca. 0.4–1.0 nm), which itself is presumably flexible under the synthesis conditions to accommodate introduction of the Cd2+ into its hydrophobic cavity (perhaps occupying micropores (Table 1); (2) the diameter is also approximately the same length as the (OH) H-bonding distances (i.e. 0.19–0.21 nm) [23] between adjacent glucose residues that form the amylose helix (believed to be key to the formation of the porous polysaccharide phase); [15,24] consequently coordination of Cd2+ may stabilise an alternative metastable polysaccharide confirmation(s), gel state and in turn expanded surface properties. It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase. CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or “seeds” (as indicated from XRD data). As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase. As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase. This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.",

    "Observed deviations from the typical, plasma-absorbing interaction region profile may explain some differences. These deviations do not necessarily mean the main interaction mode at Rhea is not plasma absorption. For instance, Simon et al. (2012) demonstrates that the combination of low magnetosonic Mach number and the high plasma beta values of Rhea’s space environment amplifies interaction features which for other plasma absorbers (e.g. Tethys, Dione, Earth’s Moon) are barely detectable. One of these features is a stronger, flow-aligned magnetic field component perturbation, which gives rise to mass-loading-like interaction signatures. Such structures may also complicate electron drifts, but to what extent it is uncertain. Similarly, the high plasma beta makes surface charging more important for Rhea compared to the other Saturnian moons (Roussos et al., 2010). Furthermore, recent developments in the study of Earth’s Moon interaction with the solar wind indicate that the standard picture for a lunar-type interaction may be too simplified: processes, such as the entry of exospheric pick-up ions in the center of the wake, backscattering on the surface and self-pick up of ambient plasma ions, appear to also have an impact on the wake dynamics (Halekas et al., 2011). For instance, the self-pick up process has been shown to lead to enhanced ULF wave activity in the lunar, at least 10% of the time (Nakagawa et al., 2012). Whether a similar process is important the inferred instability at Rhea is questionable, as the latter appears to operate continuously.",

    "An additional uncertainty arises from saturation profiling, which discerns between pores filled with brine and pores filled with CO2 above a poorly constrained level of saturation (Arts et al., 2004). It follows from the commonly used Gassmann equation (Gassmann, 1951) that: (a) very low saturations of less than a few percent are undetectable; (b) a strong correlation emerges as the gas saturation increases from a few percent to around thirty percent; and (c) for saturations much above thirty percent, it is difficult to distinguish between moderate and high saturations. It follows that the 80% gas saturation that is commonly assumed for the Sleipner plume, while reasonable (Chadwick et al., 2005; Bickle et al., 2007), remains uncertain (Lumley, 2008). If the 80% assumption represents a reasonable upper limit to the mean saturation for the plume, the lower limit could be as low as 40%, halving mass balance estimates premised on the widely assumed high-saturation value.",

C/N atomic ratios were calculated by multiplying by 1.167. Replicate analysis of well-mixed samples indicated a precision of ±<0.1. Carbon isotope analysis was carried out on 289 bulk rock samples (Table S4) after removing migrated hydrocarbons (Stephenson et al., 2005). The hydrocarbons were removed by crushing the rock fragments using a ball mill, and the soluble organic matter from all rock samples was extracted using a Soxhlet extractor. The samples were refluxed for 24 h in an azeotropic mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (93:7, v/v). All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use. Any remaining solvent was then removed by evaporation and the dried sediments were transferred to vials. Any calcites (shelly fragments) were removed by placing the samples in 5% HCl overnight before rinsing and drying down. Carbon isotope analysis was also carried out on palynology residues of the >250 μm size fractions dominated by AOM. 13C/12C analyses were performed on 35 samples by combustion in a Costech Elemental Analyser (EA) online to a VG TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer, with δ13C values calculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standards calibrated against NBS-18, NBS-19, and NBS-22.

    "Personality characteristics previously reported to be associated with tinnitus include hysteria and hypochondriasis [9,12], introversion [13], withdrawal [9], and emotional isolation [14]. Additionally, particular cognitive strategies, for example, dysfunctional and catastrophic thoughts can increase patients' emotional distress and perceived tinnitus severity, and are thought to be closely related to personality factors [15]. Neuroticism is expressed as “individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions” [16] (p. 301). At one extreme, individuals are characterized by high levels of vulnerability to experience negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and insecurity [17]. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer [18], and an increased likelihood of arthritis, kidney/liver disease, and diabetes in the general population [19]. There is evidence that neurotic traits are stronger in tinnitus patients [20], particularly in those with higher levels of tinnitus annoyance, and recent evidence that neuroticism may predict the development of severe tinnitus in patients already experiencing some tinnitus [21]. In a cross-sectional sample of 530 participants (50% with chronic tinnitus), Bartels and colleagues [22] studied the role of type D personality (the tendency towards negative affectivity and social inhibition) on health-related quality of life and self-reported tinnitus-related distress. Tinnitus patients with type D personality reported greater tinnitus-related distress and poorer health-related quality of life compared to those with other personality types. The authors concluded that some personality characteristics are associated with having tinnitus and are likely to contribute to its perceived severity.",

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash.

Our results reflected the soil respiration processes which characterize a water- and nutrient-limited forest sites such as San Rossore (Rosenkranz et al., 2006). In a recent study on the soil organic carbon of six Mediterranean forest sites in Italy, Chiti et al. (2010) reported that the pine forest of San Rossore had the lowest SOC accumulation within the top 20 cm of soil profile, and predicted that by the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol (2013–2017) would become a source of SOC.",

    "The aim of the current investigation was to determine whether fungal and bacterial species richness would affect the development of soil structural properties (e.g. aggregate stability and pore size) over a 7-month period and establish whether changes in genetic composition would be brought about by the presence of roots (either mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal). Since the premise of the investigation was to quantify the relationship between biological richness and soil structural changes over time, the soils were not pre-incubated prior to the start of the experiment. Therefore, microbial communities were allowed to develop during the course of the 7 month experiment either in the presence of mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots, or in unplanted soil, thereby allowing root associated changes in community development to be measured. Others, for example Griffiths et al. (2001) and Wertz et al. (2006), incubated soils for 9 or 4.8 months respectively to allow microbial communities to develop a similar biomass before biodiversity/function relationships were studied. In this investigation, the progression of soil structural development together with microbial compositional changes over time and in tandem with root development was characterised.",

At altitudes higher than this, collisions with H+ are more frequent. In Paper II we demonstrate that a mass loss rate of 6 × 106 kg s−1 is required to prevent diffusive separation of O (the heaviest neutral species detected so far) in the thermosphere. The mass loss rate in our models is Ṁ>107kgs-1 and thus O is dragged along to high altitudes by H. On the other hand, collisions with H+ dominate the transport of heavy ions such as Si+ as long as the ratio [H+]/[H] ≳ 10−4 (Paper II). This explains why Coulomb collisions in our models are more frequent than heavy ion–H collisions at almost all altitudes apart from the immediate vicinity of the lower boundary.

We can also compare the average sulfur content in the top few tens of centimeters of the soil of ∼4.4 wt.% inferred from Gamma Ray Spectrometer measurements (King and McLennan, 2010).

Palynological (dinoflagellate cyst, pollen, and spore assemblages) and sedimentologic (C/N ratios and kaolinite distribution) evidence indicate major changes occurred to marine and terrestrial environments in NW Europe both preceding and over the CIE. Enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input from 4 m before the CIE may indicate tectonic uplift and oceanic restriction of the North Sea, supporting hypotheses for NAIP volcanism as a trigger for the CIE (Svensen et al., 2004), and/or increased terrigenous runoff and regional precipitation, supporting hypotheses of an enhanced hydrologic cycle triggering carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002). A peak in Apectodinium before the CIE is interpreted as an ephemeral increase in terrestrial runoff causing local eutrophication. Further enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input at and immediately after the CIE onset, coupled with evidence for sea level rise in coastal areas, indicate possible increased regional precipitation over NW Europe. At this location (paleolatitude 54 oN) increased precipitation would support the hypothesis that a poleward migration of storm tracks from an enhanced hydrologic cycle resulted from global warming during the PETM (Pagani et al., 2006b).",

The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).",

Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere.

The numerical solution, shown in Fig. 10b, indeed shows an almost symmetric result. The turbine alignment consists of two distorted ∨ shapes whose open ends face the in/-outflow boundaries. Similar to the previous example, an interpretation of this alignment is to divert the stream towards the corner of the ∨ where turbines can extract large amounts of power.

An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With ηnet = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with ηnet = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3. Basically the sonic point, when it exists, moves further from the planet as the high altitude heating rate decreases.",

    "AM fungal inoculum as a single factor was significant (P < 0.001) with distinct species combinations resulting in different levels of root colonisation. The individual inocula resulted in similar levels of colonisation (9.9%–16.2%; LSD = 7.01) irrespective of species, therefore valid comparisons with and between the mixed species could be made. The highest percentage colonisation was observed in the two-species mixture of G. geosporum plus G. mosseae (25.4%), followed by the combination of all three species (23.8%). Percentage colonisation by G. geosporum plus G. mosseae in combination appeared to be additive relative to that observed by the species individually (16.2%, G. geosporum; 9.9% G. mosseae). Colonisation was markedly reduced when G. mosseae and G. intraradices were paired (7.5%), particularly compared to the performance of G. intraradices individually (14.2%). Arbuscules followed a similar pattern to hyphal colonisation, with the G. geosporum and G. mosseae combination containing the most arbuscules (data not shown).

    "As stated previously, there is considerable uncertainty in the input rate of odd nitrogen (N and NO) species from the martian ionosphere to the neutral atmosphere (Krasnopolsky, 1993). In his own model of the neutral atmosphere, Krasnopolsky considers cases both with and without input of odd nitrogen from the upper atmosphere (Krasnopolsky, 1993). We vary the input of N and NO into the model, using the nominal case as an upper limit. As these values are decreased, the pernitrate deposition flux drops, which is shown in Fig. 5. The lowest input of odd nitrogen corresponds to 3.5–6.1 (×10−4) wt.% N accumulated over 3 byr and mixed into 1.5–2.6 m of soil.",

    "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5–10 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model. Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7). However, the energy input and temperature in the model cannot be increased without bound. Higher temperatures and flux lead to more efficient ionization of the neutral species, and as a result the transit depths in the H Lyman α and O I lines begin to decrease. Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.",

    "The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere. Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.",

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured by precipitating non-HDL cholesterol with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride using a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant. Participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and new venous blood samples were taken at 2 hours postadministration of a 75 g glucose solution. Blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method on a YSI MODEL 2300 STAT PLUS Analyzer (YSI Corporation, Yellow Springs, Ohio; mean coefficient of variation: 1.4%–3.1%).

    "As 22/10a-4 is in the deep (>0.5 km) central part of the basin, it acted as a depocentre and exhibits a Paleocene-Eocene transition sequence that is not only expanded but is also close to being stratigraphically complete. The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically <10 cm). Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study. During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100 m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996). This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2). Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996). The CIE at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4. The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009). Therefore, surface water salinity changes in the North Sea Basin provide a sensitive gauge for stratification forced by changes in tectonics and the hydrologic cycle.",

Working devices with good, but lower performance were obtained without any post-annealing of the as-grown AALD ZnO. On the other hand, these unannealed AALD ZnO films are suitable for making flexible, plastic substrate solar cells. A compromise between device performance and suitability for making plastic substrate solar cells was achieved by post-annealing the ZnO films at 150 °C. The AALD ZnO fulfils the properties required for good hole blocking layers: the films are compact, have a high electron mobility, have up to 100% visible light transmittance, good blend wettability and very good device stability over time. In addition, the deposition process occurs under atmospheric conditions and has the potential to be implemented in a roll-to-roll process.

Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27).

Since the premise of the investigation was to quantify the relationship between biological richness and soil structural changes over time, the soils were not pre-incubated prior to the start of the experiment. Therefore, microbial communities were allowed to develop during the course of the 7 month experiment either in the presence of mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots, or in unplanted soil, thereby allowing root associated changes in community development to be measured. Others, for example Griffiths et al. (2001) and Wertz et al.

In this investigation, the progression of soil structural development together with microbial compositional changes over time and in tandem with root development was characterised.",

    "To deliberate the chirality of the supramolecular architecture, solid state circular dichroism spectra were measured in a KCl matrix for GMP ligand and the single-crystals of complex 1 (Fig. 3(b)). There is a red-shift in the solid state CD spectrum of GMP compared with its liquid CD spectrum. The negative band about the conformation of the sugar moiety has nearly disappeared. In solid-state, mutarotation is more difficult and the negative band at the 260 nm nearby can be detected which indicates that the GMP ligand is mainly β-anomers. In the spectrum of complex 1, the weak negative band at 215–225 nm indicates that the GMP exists as l-ribo [5], which is induced by the strong π–π and hydrogen bonding interaction. For solid samples, CD spectroscopy is highly sensitive to even a very small distortion from planarity of the aromatic chromophore [12]. The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.",

    "The PETM was a period of geologically-rapid global warming that punctuated a warming Eocene climate 55.8 Ma ago (Charles et al., 2011), and saw sea surface temperatures rise by 5–8 °C from background levels (Zachos et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2007). It was associated with a substantial injection of δ13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (see Pagani et al., 2006a) over <20 ka (Cui et al., 2011), causing a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) between −2 and −7‰ in marine and terrestrial sediments (see overview in Schouten et al., 2007) lasting 170 ka (Röhl et al., 2007), and a prominent dissolution horizon in the deep sea signifying deep ocean acidification (Kennett and Stott 1991; Zachos et al., 2005). The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).",

    "We found that the dense layers of brash produced by windrowing significantly reduced the amount of natural regeneration. Windrows could be up to a metre high and several metres wide, producing a physical barrier that prevented seedling establishment and creating regions with little or no regeneration. While we might expect seedlings from larger seeded species like rowan (200,000 seeds weigh 1 kg) to have an advantage over seedlings from smaller seeded species such as birch (5.9 million seeds weigh 1 kg) in growing through brash (Leishman and Westoby, 1994) we found no significant difference between the proportion of rowan in windrows and interrows. Furthermore, previous studies have found that where grazing pressure is high, brash (Truscott et al., 2004) and coarse woody debris (Smit et al., 2012) can help protect seedlings from browsing. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from our study as only a single site (U15) recorded significant browsing. The low incidence of browsing at our study sites (grazing pressure was controlled) means that grazing is unlikely to limit regeneration (Palmer et al., 2004; Olesen and Madsen, 2008; Yamagawa et al., 2010).",

    "To meet these challenges fertilizers recommendations to farmers become a common practice worldwide generally optimizing fertilizer doses to sustain a desired yield without a load to the environment. Consequently, soil P recommendation systems are widely used around the world to ensure good soil management and nutrient efficiency promoting agricultural sustainability. However recommendation systems differ considerably among countries. Not many systems can be found as peer reviewed literature; however a brief overview on those available is hereby given. Phosphorus recommendation systems are commonly used in Brazil, in a country where soils are generally nutrient poor. The Brazilian recommendation systems are based on quantitative analyses of soil input variables. The input variable consists of the following factors; cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), base sum, exchangeable aluminium (Al), calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg), potassium (K) and P levels, sodium (Na) saturation and electrical conductivity. The output variable of the system is the amount of fertilizer to be applied. This is mainly based on 4 classes, low, medium, high to very high (Palhares et al., 2001). While Brazil follows a detailed set of variables when recommending P fertilizer levels, the agronomists at Kansas University – who, among other land grant Universities in the United States, provide single rate recommendation for nutrients such as P – are developing a fertilizer recommendation system that gives growers the flexibility to choose a soil management practice suitable for their needs. This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the “nutrient sufficiency recommendation system” which is developed to provide a 90–95% maximum yield for the year, and the “build maintenance fertility program” based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4–8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003). In West Africa, a framework to optimize soil fertility management in rice production is in use were the yield potential is estimated by an ecophysiological model based on weather conditions, cultivar species and sowing date. This yield potential is used as an input into a static model together with field specific data such as recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous NPK supply and maximum NPK accumulation. Outputs of the framework include, required fertilizer doses to obtain different yield targets depending on yield potential and the soil nutrient supply (Haefele et al., 2003).",

Hence, many plants flourish at higher CO2 concentrations [88] and warmer temperatures, so they might be expected to thrive in the future higher CO2 environment that has been predicted with continuing climate change. An eight-year study of a deciduous forest confirmed that carbon-enrichment increased net photosynthesis by 42–48% relative to controls [89]. Similarly, free-air enrichment by supplementary CO2 in field plots increased biomass yield by 15–27% in three poplar genotypes (P. alba, P. nigra, and Populus × euramericana) [90].",

    "KSS is a multisystem disorder defined clinically by the triad of PEO and pigmentary retinopathy with onset before the age of 20 years plus at least one of: cardiac conduction block; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration greater than 0.1 g/L; cerebellar ataxia [76–80]. Frequent additional signs include sensorineural hearing loss, renal tubular acidosis, dementia, seizures, short stature and endocrine disturbance (diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism and growth hormone deficiency). A progressive skeletal myopathy is also frequently seen. The most common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with bilateral, often symmetrical, hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter, thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstem [81–83]. Interestingly, there appears to be little correlation between neurological deficits and the severity of the MRI features [84]. KSS is most commonly associated with single large-scale deletions of mtDNA [56]. We recently identified a case of KSS caused by nuclear genomic dysfunction due to mutations in RRM2B in a patient with multiple deletions of the mtDNA [85]. It is, therefore, possible for KSS to follow a Mendelian pattern of inheritance, although the majority of cases are sporadic.",

    "The generator efficiency, defined in Eq. (29), is presented in Fig. 13. Strategies A–C lead to similar generator efficiencies, the two major trends being that increased average wind speed causes a higher generator efficiency while a higher frequency of the wind speed reduces the generator efficiency. In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies. However, the generator efficiency with the reference strategy is lower at high wind frequencies. This reduced efficiency is due to high resistive loss caused by the high generator torque during the rapid oscillations. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01–0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A–C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies above 0.003 Hz, the reference strategy causes a too low average tip speed ratio which reduces energy capture, see Figs. 10 and 11.",

Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27).

    "A negative carbon isotope excursion of 5‰ has been identified from δ13CTOC and δ13CAOM in an expanded Paleocene–Eocene boundary section from the central North Sea Basin. Palynological (dinoflagellate cyst, pollen, and spore assemblages) and sedimentologic (C/N ratios and kaolinite distribution) evidence indicate major changes occurred to marine and terrestrial environments in NW Europe both preceding and over the CIE. Enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input from 4 m before the CIE may indicate tectonic uplift and oceanic restriction of the North Sea, supporting hypotheses for NAIP volcanism as a trigger for the CIE (Svensen et al., 2004), and/or increased terrigenous runoff and regional precipitation, supporting hypotheses of an enhanced hydrologic cycle triggering carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002). A peak in Apectodinium before the CIE is interpreted as an ephemeral increase in terrestrial runoff causing local eutrophication. Further enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input at and immediately after the CIE onset, coupled with evidence for sea level rise in coastal areas, indicate possible increased regional precipitation over NW Europe. At this location (paleolatitude 54 oN) increased precipitation would support the hypothesis that a poleward migration of storm tracks from an enhanced hydrologic cycle resulted from global warming during the PETM (Pagani et al., 2006b).",

Microscopic inspection revealed that the grafts had been maintained as a largely intact and continuous cell monolayer. A positive pan-cytokeratin (pCK) signal, an established RPE marker, was confirmed for fetal and adult hRPE monolayers (Figures 3A and 3C). Additional pCK reactivity was seen “underneath” the cell carrier, likely from host RPE. Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3). Costaining of SC121 with an antibody to MCT1 and Ezrin, both apical membrane markers, further confirmed that the RPE were (still) polarized (Figure 3). SC121+ RPE transplants were negative for the expression of the cell-cycle marker ki67, the proliferation marker phosphohistone H3, and for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (Figures 3F–3H), indicating absence of proliferation and apoptosis. We estimated the total human RPE cell survival to be approximately 95% after 1 month by using the SC121 positivity; we measured the total length of the carrier and the length of SC121 stain and calculated the percent coverage of SC121 over the total carrier length. On transmission electron micrography (TEM), polarized RPE cells were observed on the PET carriers from both fetal and adult transplants (Figures 3I and 3J).

    "A total of 71 palynology samples were prepared at the British Geological Survey using standard preparation procedures (Moore et al., 1991). Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C. Foraminifera samples between 20 and 60 g of dried sediment were processed by washing through a 63 μm sieve with water. All specimens were counted and converted to foraminifera/g (Table S2).

When these images were taken, both detectors could not be in good focus at the same time.) It appears that only BS1 was recorded in this image sequence, perhaps because the filter penetration depth is too shallow to see the apparently deeper BS2 feature, which should have crossed the central meridian about 30 min after BS1.

    "The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere. Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.",

    "In upland areas of Great Britain, large tracts of non-native conifer plantations have been established on poor quality agricultural land. There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species. We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120 m to 380 m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers. Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000 stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations. Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.",

    "In the present study, both aggregate stability and repellency were reduced in month 7; specifically the degree of reduction in repellency was less in the mycorrhizal soils than in the non-mycorrhizal soils. In the mycorrhizal soils, aggregate water repellency was also negatively correlated with bacterial (and fungal) TRF richness but positively correlated with root size and microbial biomass-C. It is likely that mycorrhizal hyphae contributed to the microbial biomass-C measured here which might explain why microbial biomass-C was not a factor in the model explaining repellency in the NM soils. In the mycorrhizal soils the relationship between microbial biomass-C and aggregate stability was negative, whilst it was positive for repellency. The GLM regressions used data for all 7 months but the system was dynamic across the months. For example, aggregate stability was greater in the mycorrhizal soils in month 3, yet repellency increased in months 5 and 7. The positive relationship observed between per cent root length colonised and microbial biomass-C is likely to be the result of increasing hyphal length in the soil, or possibly an enhancement of other microbial species too, since internal AMF root colonisation may not reflect the extraradical hyphal biomass. Aggregate turnover rates range from 4 to 88 days (De Gryze et al. 2005, 2006); an increase in aggregate stability observed here over a 60 day period (from the first to third month harvest) and an increase in aggregate water repellency over a 120 day period (from the first to fifth month harvest) is comparable to that observed by others.",

We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 °C and the other at 38 °C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).",

Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27).

One patient, a 67-year-old male with sporadic FTD, tested negative for mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9ORF72. The other patient, a 64-year-old male with a significant family history of dementia, had behavioral variant FTD. MRI in this patient demonstrated severe bifrontal and temporal atrophy associated with gliosis in the frontal lobes (greater on the right). One year later, MRI scans showed progression of atrophy and gliosis. Genetic testing revealed a novel nonsense mutation in GRN, p.S116X (g.4627C > A, c.347C > A), which is predicted to result in a premature stop codon. Both FTD patients had parkinsonism, which is typical of all FTD patients with PGRN mutations. An age-matched subject, a clinically normal 64-year-old male with no mutations in GRN, MAPT, or C9ORF72, served as a control.",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

A PCR analysis revealed that all of the clones with retroviral vectors showed apparent expression of remaining transgenes (Figures S1C and S1D), whereas the clones with episomal vectors never did (Figure S1F).

    "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (∼33.7 Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive. Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.",

Carbon isotope analysis was carried out on 289 bulk rock samples (Table S4) after removing migrated hydrocarbons (Stephenson et al., 2005). The hydrocarbons were removed by crushing the rock fragments using a ball mill, and the soluble organic matter from all rock samples was extracted using a Soxhlet extractor.

All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use.

We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF. However, this region is strongly dependent on the plasma flow model used and poorly constrained by observations.",

    "The effect of changing the heating efficiency on the velocity profile is quite dramatic. As ηnet ranges from 0.1 to 1 (with the average solar flux), the velocity at the upper boundary increases from 2.6 km s−1 to 25 km s−1. However, the velocity does not increase linearly with stellar flux or without a bound – in the 100× case the velocity at the upper boundary is only 30 km s−1. An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With ηnet = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with ηnet = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3. Basically the sonic point, when it exists, moves further from the planet as the high altitude heating rate decreases.",

    "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (∼33.7 Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive. Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.",

We selected the best clone from each animal according to the following criteria: a stable embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like morphology of the colonies after passaging, expression of pluripotent markers, few or no integrated transgenes (Figures 1A–1F; Figure S1 available online), and the potential for stable neural differentiation. A PCR analysis revealed that all of the clones with retroviral vectors showed apparent expression of remaining transgenes (Figures S1C and S1D), whereas the clones with episomal vectors never did (Figure S1F). To detect the iPSC-derived cells in a brain, we introduced GFP (Figures 1G and 1H).

These values agree with the observed values to better than 2σ.

These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively.

However, the extent to which this association was attributable to vascular risk factors alone is difficult to assess in such a study design. In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression. This null finding was evident irrespective of whether assessment of depression was based on CES-D or a clinical diagnosis obtained from a psychiatric interview (11).

(3) The regional masks were down-sampled to a cubic source grid with voxels of 5 mm per side (Fig. 1E). (4) VESTAL MEG source imaging used the source grid from step 3. This step permits group-based analyses. In the shown example, MEG responses evoked by S1 localized to left and right Heschl's gyri (Fig. 1F).

There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species. We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120 m to 380 m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers. Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000 stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations. Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.",

    "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.",

    "For late Quaternary records, most tephra horizons in sediment cores are dated by (linear) interpolation of 14C dates of carbonates, bulk sediment or organic remains. However, lakes are especially prone to a reservoir effect, due to dissolution of ancient carbonates and/or old organic matter that is washed into the lake from the catchment and incorporated into the sediment. Both phenomena can result in anomalous 14C ages and an offset from the real age of the dated material, which is not necessarily constant through time in the sediment section (Geyh et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2007). This offset from the real age can be of the order of several hundred or even more than a thousand years if bulk sediment or carbonates are dated, and can thus lead to misleading or erroneous age models if it is not taken into account (Geyh et al., 1998; Bertrand et al., 2012). Sediment sections spanning time intervals with multiple tephra layers could therefore easily be miscorrelated if the tephra is not adequately characterised to back up correlations. Appropriate tephra characterisation can potentially also help in evaluating the reservoir effect in a sediment section by providing a tie-point in the age model, provided the age of the tephra is well known from one or more independent sources (e.g., 14C dating on charcoal incorporated in terrestrial deposits, for example the well-constrained 3.00–3.05 ka cal BP Alpehué Pumice (So-A) eruption from Sollipulli; Supplementary Table 1; Naranjo et al., 1993b).",

    "Personality characteristics previously reported to be associated with tinnitus include hysteria and hypochondriasis [9,12], introversion [13], withdrawal [9], and emotional isolation [14]. Additionally, particular cognitive strategies, for example, dysfunctional and catastrophic thoughts can increase patients' emotional distress and perceived tinnitus severity, and are thought to be closely related to personality factors [15]. Neuroticism is expressed as “individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions” [16] (p. 301). At one extreme, individuals are characterized by high levels of vulnerability to experience negative emotions, including sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, and insecurity [17]. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. Neuroticism has been associated with adverse outcomes in various health conditions, including increased likelihood of morbidity in those with testicular cancer [18], and an increased likelihood of arthritis, kidney/liver disease, and diabetes in the general population [19]. There is evidence that neurotic traits are stronger in tinnitus patients [20], particularly in those with higher levels of tinnitus annoyance, and recent evidence that neuroticism may predict the development of severe tinnitus in patients already experiencing some tinnitus [21]. In a cross-sectional sample of 530 participants (50% with chronic tinnitus), Bartels and colleagues [22] studied the role of type D personality (the tendency towards negative affectivity and social inhibition) on health-related quality of life and self-reported tinnitus-related distress. Tinnitus patients with type D personality reported greater tinnitus-related distress and poorer health-related quality of life compared to those with other personality types. The authors concluded that some personality characteristics are associated with having tinnitus and are likely to contribute to its perceived severity.",

In the case of P, decreased values compared to the blank were found for bed inventories of 4.5 kg and 13 kg, but an increased value for 6 kg inventory. However, the values are very low at <0.01 ppm and this anomalous result may be due to analytical errors.

For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig. S4). After 8 days in spinner flask followed by 4 days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a). In contrast, undifferentiated hiPSCs on day 0 showed negative staining of all germ markers (data not shown). For in vivo assay, BC1 and TNC1 harvested from suspension culture in spinner flasks were injected into immune-deficient mice and were able to form teratomas containing cells of all germ layers, including glandular epithelium, chondrocytes, and neural rosettes (Fig. 5b). Directed hematopoietic differentiation potential was also tested as previously described (Fig. 5c). Differentiating BC1 and TNC1 cells contained 43.57% ± 4.35% (n = 3) and 43.22% ± 7.13% (n = 3) CD34+CD45+ HPCs on day 14 of differentiation, respectively.

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

    "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.",

In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies. However, the generator efficiency with the reference strategy is lower at high wind frequencies. This reduced efficiency is due to high resistive loss caused by the high generator torque during the rapid oscillations. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01–0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A–C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss.

In solid-state, mutarotation is more difficult and the negative band at the 260 nm nearby can be detected which indicates that the GMP ligand is mainly β-anomers. In the spectrum of complex 1, the weak negative band at 215–225 nm indicates that the GMP exists as l-ribo [5], which is induced by the strong π–π and hydrogen bonding interaction. For solid samples, CD spectroscopy is highly sensitive to even a very small distortion from planarity of the aromatic chromophore [12]. The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.",

    "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.",

Therefore, the tidal period was defined to be P ≡ 10 min, which resulted in a tidal range of ±12 m. The simulation time was set to one full tidal period with a time step of Δt = 12 s.

We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF.

Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54 °N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments. The CIE onset is identified from organic matter δ13C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence. Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass. Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103 yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle. Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM. Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores. This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate. A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.",

The MMNm component is an early (between 100 and 200 ms), automatic or largely pre-attentive response (Naatanen et al., 2007). Particularly relevant is that a prefrontal contribution to change detection also occurs within this early time window, demonstrated in Garrido and colleagues' dynamic causal modelling of a roving oddball paradigm (Garrido et al., 2008) and the effects of frontal lesions (Alho et al., 1994). This suggests that if the prefrontal cortical dysfunction in the two patient groups is the cause of the altered network response, then this affects the very early stages of stimuli processing. Although this early component is distinct from the later M300 response, which reflects attentional processing (Wronka et al., 2008), it is still relevant to high order cognitive processes, (Naatanen et al., 2007, 2012).",

    "To meet these challenges fertilizers recommendations to farmers become a common practice worldwide generally optimizing fertilizer doses to sustain a desired yield without a load to the environment. Consequently, soil P recommendation systems are widely used around the world to ensure good soil management and nutrient efficiency promoting agricultural sustainability. However recommendation systems differ considerably among countries. Not many systems can be found as peer reviewed literature; however a brief overview on those available is hereby given. Phosphorus recommendation systems are commonly used in Brazil, in a country where soils are generally nutrient poor. The Brazilian recommendation systems are based on quantitative analyses of soil input variables. The input variable consists of the following factors; cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), base sum, exchangeable aluminium (Al), calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg), potassium (K) and P levels, sodium (Na) saturation and electrical conductivity. The output variable of the system is the amount of fertilizer to be applied. This is mainly based on 4 classes, low, medium, high to very high (Palhares et al., 2001). While Brazil follows a detailed set of variables when recommending P fertilizer levels, the agronomists at Kansas University – who, among other land grant Universities in the United States, provide single rate recommendation for nutrients such as P – are developing a fertilizer recommendation system that gives growers the flexibility to choose a soil management practice suitable for their needs. This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the “nutrient sufficiency recommendation system” which is developed to provide a 90–95% maximum yield for the year, and the “build maintenance fertility program” based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4–8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003). In West Africa, a framework to optimize soil fertility management in rice production is in use were the yield potential is estimated by an ecophysiological model based on weather conditions, cultivar species and sowing date. This yield potential is used as an input into a static model together with field specific data such as recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous NPK supply and maximum NPK accumulation. Outputs of the framework include, required fertilizer doses to obtain different yield targets depending on yield potential and the soil nutrient supply (Haefele et al., 2003).",

    "Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.",

    "H-band slit-viewing VLT images taken on 6 November 2011 UT, just two days before the close approach of BS1 and BS2. (The relatively poor quality of the images arises from optimization of image quality for the science detector, which records spectra, instead of the slit viewing detector. When these images were taken, both detectors could not be in good focus at the same time.) It appears that only BS1 was recorded in this image sequence, perhaps because the filter penetration depth is too shallow to see the apparently deeper BS2 feature, which should have crossed the central meridian about 30 min after BS1. It may also be that BS2 was of lower reflectivity before passing BS1 than it was afterwards (it is quite obvious in the K′ image of Fig. 13).",

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

Venous blood was taken in the fasting state or at least 5 hours after a light, fat-free breakfast. Serum for lipid analyses was refrigerated at −4°C and assayed within 72 hours. Cholesterol was measured with the use of a Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (Roche Diagnostics System, Nutley, New Jersey). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured by precipitating non-HDL cholesterol with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride using a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant. Participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and new venous blood samples were taken at 2 hours postadministration of a 75 g glucose solution. Blood glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method on a YSI MODEL 2300 STAT PLUS Analyzer (YSI Corporation, Yellow Springs, Ohio; mean coefficient of variation: 1.4%–3.1%). Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2-hour postload glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L, reported doctor diagnosed diabetes, or use of diabetes medication (24). We measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure twice in the sitting position after 5 minutes rest with a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer (phases 3 and 5) (Lynjay Services Ltd., Worthing, United Kingdom) and OMRON HEM 907 (phase 7) (Omron, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom), the average of two readings used in the analysis. Atrial fibrillation was identified on the Glasgow 12-lead electrocardiogram analysis program combined with manual review (Prof. P. Macfarlane, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom). Limb lead electrocardiograms were classified according to the Minnesota code (25), with tall R waves (codes 3-1 to 3-3) used to reflect left ventricular hypertrophy.

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

    "S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae are the most common pathogens implicated in OME, and all are capable of forming biofilms [33,42]. However, rather than focusing just on those three bacteria, this study cultured effusions on a wide range of different media for prolonged time periods in order to capture as many isolates as possible. Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp. and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study. CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43]. S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45]. Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47]. Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe that inhabits the mouth and upper respiratory tract, forms biofilms [48] and has previously been found in middle ear disease [49,50]. S. aureus also forms biofilms and has been identified in middle ear disease [51,52]. Although most of the bacteria in Table 2 have previously been isolated in middle ear disease, to the best of the authors’ knowledge Flavimonas oryzihabitans, Vibrio metschnikovii and Gemella haemolysans have not been implicated previously.",

Percentage colonisation by G. geosporum plus G. mosseae in combination appeared to be additive relative to that observed by the species individually (16.2%, G. geosporum; 9.9% G. mosseae). Colonisation was markedly reduced when G. mosseae and G. intraradices were paired (7.5%), particularly compared to the performance of G. intraradices individually (14.2%).

    "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.",

We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 °C and the other at 38 °C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).",

The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions.

In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression.

In the mid-term there is the Staebler–Wronski effect for a-Si [48,49] or pre-conditioning for CIGS, which affects the annual energy prediction by less than 5% typically and are not further explored here. The effect for CIGS is slightly contradictory as there is no clarity of the time scales involved yet [4,50]. There are also long-term gradual degradation effects which affect all device technologies [51]. In many published discussions there are generalisations of technologies. It is shown below that such a general behaviour was not observed at CREST.

This particular irradiance level was chosen as there is a statistically significant number of data points in each month of the year and thus fewer outliers to affect the analysis.

As coherent clusters are dependent on both backward and forward slices, such clusters will be more sensitive to changes in dependences within the program. The SCGs show that from the initial version barcode-0.90 there were two coherent clusters in the system. The smaller one is around 10% of the code while the larger is around 40% of the code. As the system evolved and went through various modifications and enhancements, the number of clusters and the profile of the clusters remained consistent other than its scaled growth with the increase in program size. It is also evident that during evolution of the system, the enhancement code or newly added code formed part of the larger cluster. This is why in the later stages of the evolution we see an increase in the size of the largest cluster, but not the smaller one.",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

    "The cutoff level of the empirical model is somewhat arbitrary. For neutral species it is partly based on ionization (K10), but this criterion obviously does not apply to ions. With a cutoff level at 5Rp for the ions only, the M7 model yields line-integrated transit depths of 3.9%, 8%, and 5.8% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively, if 40% of silicon is Si2+. These values agree with the observed values to better than 2σ. Similarly, by extending the cutoff level of the C2 model to 5Rp, we obtained transit depths of 3.2%, 6.7%, and 4.6% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively (see Table 2). These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively. The transit depths predicted by the M7 model are higher partly because the mean temperature of 8250 K is higher than the corresponding temperature in the C2 model (Paper I).

We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF.

With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women). Since the phase 1 medical examination, follow-up examinations have taken place approximately every 5 years: phase 3 (1991 to 1993, n = 8815); phase 5 (1997 to 1999, n = 7870); phase 7 (2003 to 2004, n = 6967); and phase 9 (2008 to 2009, n = 6761). Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here.

The deposition velocity is a scaling factor that affects the transport of species from the bulk atmosphere to the surface in the absence of rain. The deposition velocity is coupled to the gas concentrations computed by chemical kinetics. Following Zahnle et al. (2008), we apply a deposition velocity of 0.02 cm s−1 to all species, with two exceptions. First, the deposition velocities for O2, H2, and CO are set to zero (following Zahnle et al., 2008). Second, all species with a zero deposition velocity in Catling et al. (2010) are prescribed a zero deposition velocity because we consider them to be nonreactive.

    "In the present study, both aggregate stability and repellency were reduced in month 7; specifically the degree of reduction in repellency was less in the mycorrhizal soils than in the non-mycorrhizal soils. In the mycorrhizal soils, aggregate water repellency was also negatively correlated with bacterial (and fungal) TRF richness but positively correlated with root size and microbial biomass-C. It is likely that mycorrhizal hyphae contributed to the microbial biomass-C measured here which might explain why microbial biomass-C was not a factor in the model explaining repellency in the NM soils. In the mycorrhizal soils the relationship between microbial biomass-C and aggregate stability was negative, whilst it was positive for repellency. The GLM regressions used data for all 7 months but the system was dynamic across the months. For example, aggregate stability was greater in the mycorrhizal soils in month 3, yet repellency increased in months 5 and 7. The positive relationship observed between per cent root length colonised and microbial biomass-C is likely to be the result of increasing hyphal length in the soil, or possibly an enhancement of other microbial species too, since internal AMF root colonisation may not reflect the extraradical hyphal biomass. Aggregate turnover rates range from 4 to 88 days (De Gryze et al. 2005, 2006); an increase in aggregate stability observed here over a 60 day period (from the first to third month harvest) and an increase in aggregate water repellency over a 120 day period (from the first to fifth month harvest) is comparable to that observed by others.",

Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27).

In the mid-term there is the Staebler–Wronski effect for a-Si [48,49] or pre-conditioning for CIGS, which affects the annual energy prediction by less than 5% typically and are not further explored here. The effect for CIGS is slightly contradictory as there is no clarity of the time scales involved yet [4,50]. There are also long-term gradual degradation effects which affect all device technologies [51]. In many published discussions there are generalisations of technologies.

For the other two animals (Nos. 6 and 8), we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with nonintegrating episomal vectors (Okita et al., 2013). We selected the best clone from each animal according to the following criteria: a stable embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like morphology of the colonies after passaging, expression of pluripotent markers, few or no integrated transgenes (Figures 1A–1F; Figure S1 available online), and the potential for stable neural differentiation. A PCR analysis revealed that all of the clones with retroviral vectors showed apparent expression of remaining transgenes (Figures S1C and S1D), whereas the clones with episomal vectors never did (Figure S1F). To detect the iPSC-derived cells in a brain, we introduced GFP (Figures 1G and 1H).

    "As 22/10a-4 is in the deep (>0.5 km) central part of the basin, it acted as a depocentre and exhibits a Paleocene-Eocene transition sequence that is not only expanded but is also close to being stratigraphically complete. The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically <10 cm). Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study. During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100 m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996). This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2). Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996). The CIE at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4. The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009). Therefore, surface water salinity changes in the North Sea Basin provide a sensitive gauge for stratification forced by changes in tectonics and the hydrologic cycle.",

    "A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described. This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid. The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.",

The mt-LSU protein ICT1 was also decreased (~ 30% of control values) as was MRPL3 (by 37%) suggesting that a consequence of the MRPL12 mutation is a global defect in assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU). In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

Similar to the previous example, an interpretation of this alignment is to divert the stream towards the corner of the ∨ where turbines can extract large amounts of power.

    "A negative carbon isotope excursion of 5‰ has been identified from δ13CTOC and δ13CAOM in an expanded Paleocene–Eocene boundary section from the central North Sea Basin. Palynological (dinoflagellate cyst, pollen, and spore assemblages) and sedimentologic (C/N ratios and kaolinite distribution) evidence indicate major changes occurred to marine and terrestrial environments in NW Europe both preceding and over the CIE. Enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input from 4 m before the CIE may indicate tectonic uplift and oceanic restriction of the North Sea, supporting hypotheses for NAIP volcanism as a trigger for the CIE (Svensen et al., 2004), and/or increased terrigenous runoff and regional precipitation, supporting hypotheses of an enhanced hydrologic cycle triggering carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002). A peak in Apectodinium before the CIE is interpreted as an ephemeral increase in terrestrial runoff causing local eutrophication. Further enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous input at and immediately after the CIE onset, coupled with evidence for sea level rise in coastal areas, indicate possible increased regional precipitation over NW Europe. At this location (paleolatitude 54 oN) increased precipitation would support the hypothesis that a poleward migration of storm tracks from an enhanced hydrologic cycle resulted from global warming during the PETM (Pagani et al., 2006b).",

The target population was all London-based office staff, aged 35 to 55, working in 20 civil service departments on recruitment to the study in 1985 to 1988 (phase 1). With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women). Since the phase 1 medical examination, follow-up examinations have taken place approximately every 5 years: phase 3 (1991 to 1993, n = 8815); phase 5 (1997 to 1999, n = 7870); phase 7 (2003 to 2004, n = 6967); and phase 9 (2008 to 2009, n = 6761). Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here.

    "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.",

    "Large-scale production of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by robust and economic methods has been one of the major challenges for translational realization of hiPSC technology. Here we demonstrate a scalable culture system for hiPSC expansion using the E8 chemically defined and xeno-free medium under either adherent or suspension conditions. To optimize suspension conditions guided by a computational simulation, we developed a method to efficiently expand hiPSCs as undifferentiated aggregates in spinner flasks. Serial passaging of two different hiPSC lines in the spinner flasks using the E8 medium preserved their normal karyotype and expression of undifferentiated state markers of TRA-1–60, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG. The hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages not only could be remained pluripotent as indicated by in vitro and in vivo assays, but also could be efficiently induced toward mesodermal and hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, we established a xeno-free protocol of single-cell cryopreservation and recovery for the scalable production of hiPSCs in spinner flasks. This system is the first to enable an efficient scale-up bioprocess in completely xeno-free condition for the expansion and cryopreservation of hiPSCs with the quantity and quality compliant for clinical applications.",

    "Next we apply the multi-phase fluid flow simulations of Lengler et al. (2010) to account for the lateral variability in the petrophysical properties of the storage formation at Ketzin. Lengler et al. (2010) performed simulations on multiple realizations of the Ketzin reservoir using a stochastic Monte Carlo approach in order to take into account the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir characterization at the scale required for fluid flow simulations. In this paper, we use a similar approach, but this time to investigate the impact of the reservoir temperature on the fluid migration and, in turn, on the 4D seismic data. Hydrogeological studies at the Ketzin site (Norden et al., 2010) have shown that a 2D radially symmetric model of the upper part (33 m) of the Stuttgart Formation can be used to interpret the 3D data acquired near the injection well (Fig. 7). This model accounts for the presence of channel sandstones in the reservoir that are the most favorable for CO2 migration and contains effective porosities in the range of 20–25% (Förster et al., 2010). As known from core and log analysis of the injection well Ktzi201/2007 and the first observation well Ktzi200/2007, the reservoir is composed of two high porosity sandstone layers. These layers are separated by a thin strongly cemented sandstone layer (Norden et al., 2010). Since the thickness of this layer is in the decimeter range, it cannot be detected with the seismic wavelengths typically available from surface-seismic measurements. However, this layer is known to be a significant constraint to fluid migration due to its low permeability (Wiese et al., 2010).",

    "The substellar tide is included in the C3 model. We included it mainly to compare our results with previous models (Garcia Munoz, 2007; Penz et al., 2008; Murray-Clay et al., 2009). The substellar tide is not a particularly good representation of the stellar tide in a globally averaged sense. In reality, including tides in the models is much more complicated than simply considering the substellar tide (e.g., Trammell et al., 2011). Compared to the C1 model, the maximum temperature in the C3 model is cooler by ∼1000 K and at high altitudes the C3 model is cooler by 1000–2000 K. The velocity is faster and hence adiabatic cooling is also more efficient. The substellar tide drives supersonic escape (see also, Penz et al., 2008) and the sonic point in the C3 model is at a much lower altitude than in the C1 model (see Section 3.1.3). However, it is not clear how the sonic point behaves as a function of latitude and longitude. Given that the tide is also likely to induce horizontal flows, it cannot be included accurately in 1D models.",

    "In sequential PET studies, we observed increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 in one allograft (animal No. 10) at 3 months (Figures 3A and 3B). We could not detect any apparent uptake in the other animals or at any other time points (Figure S2). Intriguingly, the serum level of IFN-γ temporarily increased at 2 months after the transplant in three animals (Figure 3C). An immunofluorescence study conducted at 3.5–4 months showed that MHC-II+ cells were more frequently found in allografts than in autografts, especially in the monkey with increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 (Figure 3D, No. 10). The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells. An immunofluorescence study revealed that more CD45+ cells (a marker for pan-leukocytes) accumulated in allografts compared with autografts (Figures 3I and 3J). Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).

Microscopic inspection revealed that the grafts had been maintained as a largely intact and continuous cell monolayer. A positive pan-cytokeratin (pCK) signal, an established RPE marker, was confirmed for fetal and adult hRPE monolayers (Figures 3A and 3C). Additional pCK reactivity was seen “underneath” the cell carrier, likely from host RPE. Moreover, fetal and adult hRPE on PET carriers stained positively for the human-specific marker SC121, confirming survival of human RPE for 1 month as a monolayer (Figure 3). Costaining of SC121 with an antibody to MCT1 and Ezrin, both apical membrane markers, further confirmed that the RPE were (still) polarized (Figure 3). SC121+ RPE transplants were negative for the expression of the cell-cycle marker ki67, the proliferation marker phosphohistone H3, and for the apoptotic marker caspase-3 (Figures 3F–3H), indicating absence of proliferation and apoptosis. We estimated the total human RPE cell survival to be approximately 95% after 1 month by using the SC121 positivity; we measured the total length of the carrier and the length of SC121 stain and calculated the percent coverage of SC121 over the total carrier length. On transmission electron micrography (TEM), polarized RPE cells were observed on the PET carriers from both fetal and adult transplants (Figures 3I and 3J).

The mass loss rate in our models is Ṁ>107kgs-1 and thus O is dragged along to high altitudes by H. On the other hand, collisions with H+ dominate the transport of heavy ions such as Si+ as long as the ratio [H+]/[H] ≳ 10−4 (Paper II).

We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 °C and the other at 38 °C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).",

However, the extent to which this association was attributable to vascular risk factors alone is difficult to assess in such a study design. In the Rotterdam study of older adults followed up for 6 years (11), none of the objective atherosclerosis measures was linked with subsequent depression. This null finding was evident irrespective of whether assessment of depression was based on CES-D or a clinical diagnosis obtained from a psychiatric interview (11).

    "The PETM was a period of geologically-rapid global warming that punctuated a warming Eocene climate 55.8 Ma ago (Charles et al., 2011), and saw sea surface temperatures rise by 5–8 °C from background levels (Zachos et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2007). It was associated with a substantial injection of δ13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (see Pagani et al., 2006a) over <20 ka (Cui et al., 2011), causing a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) between −2 and −7‰ in marine and terrestrial sediments (see overview in Schouten et al., 2007) lasting 170 ka (Röhl et al., 2007), and a prominent dissolution horizon in the deep sea signifying deep ocean acidification (Kennett and Stott 1991; Zachos et al., 2005). The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).",

All samples in this study were taken from claystone horizons to avoid sampling substantial quantities of reworked material. The section of 22/10a-4 analysed in this study is from 2605 m to 2634 m (core depth), chosen because this part of the core is predominantly in claystone facies and provides a greatly expanded section over the onset of the CIE (Figs. 2 and 3). At 2609–2613 m the claystone becomes finely laminated with alternately pale and dark laminae couplets ranging from 1 to 25 per mm (Fig. S2). The pale laminae consist of clay and silt, and the dark laminae are rich in organic carbon and pyrite inclusions.

    "For cell differentiation, FAP-specific iPS cells were cultured with serial changes of media as shown in Fig. 3A. To test whether FAP-specific iPS cells can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, we analyzed several markers via real-time PCR analysis on Day 5 (D5), D13 and D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells (Fig. 3B). A decrease in expression of the pluripotency marker Oct3/4 was accompanied by differentiation of FAP-specific iPS cells. Expression of the endoderm marker Sox17 was observed on D5 differentiation and decreased gradually after the medium was changed to hepatic differentiation medium on D7 (Fig. 3B). The hepatic progenitor marker AFP and the mature hepatocyte marker ALB were obviously expressed on D13 and D20. In addition, immunocytochemical analyses showed Sox17 expression on D5, both HNF-4α and AFP expression on D13, and ALB cytoplasmic staining on D20 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative imaging analysis revealed that approximately 78 ± 0.6% of cells were Sox17-positive on D5 and approximately 88 ± 1.1% of cells were AFP-positive on D13 and approximately 29 ± 0.9% of cells were ALB-positive on D20 (Fig. 3D). The ALB secretion in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells on D20 was approximately 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3E). Moreover, these D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells were also periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, indicating cytoplasmic glycogen storage (Fig. 3F). These results clearly indicated that FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells.",

    "Large-scale production of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by robust and economic methods has been one of the major challenges for translational realization of hiPSC technology. Here we demonstrate a scalable culture system for hiPSC expansion using the E8 chemically defined and xeno-free medium under either adherent or suspension conditions. To optimize suspension conditions guided by a computational simulation, we developed a method to efficiently expand hiPSCs as undifferentiated aggregates in spinner flasks. Serial passaging of two different hiPSC lines in the spinner flasks using the E8 medium preserved their normal karyotype and expression of undifferentiated state markers of TRA-1–60, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG. The hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages not only could be remained pluripotent as indicated by in vitro and in vivo assays, but also could be efficiently induced toward mesodermal and hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, we established a xeno-free protocol of single-cell cryopreservation and recovery for the scalable production of hiPSCs in spinner flasks. This system is the first to enable an efficient scale-up bioprocess in completely xeno-free condition for the expansion and cryopreservation of hiPSCs with the quantity and quality compliant for clinical applications.",

These values agree with the observed values to better than 2σ. Similarly, by extending the cutoff level of the C2 model to 5Rp, we obtained transit depths of 3.2%, 6.7%, and 4.6% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively (see Table 2). These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively.

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

    "Minority carrier lifetime was measured using transient or quasi-steady-state photoconductance [38] methods, with a Sinton WCT-120 lifetime tester. The injection level range studied varied with the lifetime of the sample, but was usually in the range 1013 cm−3 to 1016 cm−3. It is our aim to determine the absolute lifetime associated with oxygen precipitation, so care was taken to prevent or factor out well-understood recombination processes. Boron–oxygen defects were eliminated by storing the samples in the dark after passivation, or by performing a 10 min pre-anneal at 200 °C [39] prior to lifetime measurement. The samples were subjected to ∼50 close-up flashes from the lifetime tester to dissociate FeB pairs [40], after which an initial lifetime measurement was made immediately. It is noted that the aggregated illumination time of the flashes of light used to dissociate the iron–boron pairs is very short (<20  ms), so any effect on the formation of boron–oxygen defects is kept to a minimum [39]. A second lifetime measurement was made more than 24 h later, which was sufficient time to reassociate the FeB pairs [19,34,41]. The two lifetime measurements are then analysed to give the concentration of iron that exists in FeB pairs using an established method [30,40,42]. This concentration is henceforth referred to as the bulk iron concentration, and excludes iron present in other forms such as iron silicide precipitates, or iron bound to, or precipitated at, oxide precipitates and any surrounding defects. The specific analysis approach used is described in a previous publication [19]. The essential feature is that SRH statistics (Eq. (1)) are used with the recombination parameters of Rein and Glunz [30] to determine the bulk iron concentration required to account for a lifetime change at a given injection level. For the results presented in this paper, the injection level used was 0.2p0. The bulk iron concentrations in the “uncontaminated” samples were always ≤1.5×1012 cm−3.",

In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.",

    "BC1 and TNC1 hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages were tested for their pluripotency by in vitro and in vivo differentiation methods. For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig. S4). After 8 days in spinner flask followed by 4 days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a). In contrast, undifferentiated hiPSCs on day 0 showed negative staining of all germ markers (data not shown). For in vivo assay, BC1 and TNC1 harvested from suspension culture in spinner flasks were injected into immune-deficient mice and were able to form teratomas containing cells of all germ layers, including glandular epithelium, chondrocytes, and neural rosettes (Fig. 5b). Directed hematopoietic differentiation potential was also tested as previously described (Fig. 5c). Differentiating BC1 and TNC1 cells contained 43.57% ± 4.35% (n = 3) and 43.22% ± 7.13% (n = 3) CD34+CD45+ HPCs on day 14 of differentiation, respectively. The CFU assay measuring hematopoietic progenitors showed that hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks were able to generate colonies of different hematopoietic cell lineages. The total number of CFUs was comparable or significantly larger (P = 0.0307, n = 3) than cells cultured in parallel in adhesion cultures (Fig. 5d).",

    "The Whitehall II study is a prospective cohort study of British civil servants established in 1985 to study associations between risk factors, pathophysiological changes, and clinical disease (22). The target population was all London-based office staff, aged 35 to 55, working in 20 civil service departments on recruitment to the study in 1985 to 1988 (phase 1). With a response of 73%, the cohort consisted of 10,308 employees (6895 men and 3413 women). Since the phase 1 medical examination, follow-up examinations have taken place approximately every 5 years: phase 3 (1991 to 1993, n = 8815); phase 5 (1997 to 1999, n = 7870); phase 7 (2003 to 2004, n = 6967); and phase 9 (2008 to 2009, n = 6761). Phase 3 was the first time that all components of the Framingham risk algorithms were measured, making it the baseline for the analyses we report here. We use data from three screening cycles: from phase 3 to phase 5, from phase 5 to phase 7, and from phase 7 to phase 9 with phases 3, 5, and 7 providing baseline measures of vascular risk to assess incidence of depressive symptoms at phases 5, 7, and 9 in the three data cycles, respectively.",

To reduce the probability of tip fracture during 3DAP evaporation of the atomic layers, we used field evaporation with a laser pulse instead of an electric field pulse. The 3DAP observation conditions were as follows: laser energy of 0.5–0.6 nJ, a laser-pulse repetition rate of 250 kHz, a DC bias voltage of 4–7 kV, and a specimen temperature of 55 K. The DC voltage was automatically controlled to keep a constant evaporation rate of 0.4% at constant energy of the laser pulse. The Ga+-irradiated regions by FIB around the top of the thinned tip were fractured before 3DAP observation at a DC voltage range of 2–4 kV. The computer program IVAS3.6.1 (Cameca Instruments Inc.) was used to analyze the data. Orientations of the screw dislocations were defined with high accuracy on the basis of {111} planes of stacking faults, which were observed while mapping the same atom.

The tensile yield stress is calculated from the measured compressive yield stress [39]. The addition of S-CSR particles reduces the compressive true yield stress, as expected, due to the relative softness of the polysiloxane rubber. The values decreased approximately linearly with increasing S-CSR particle content, see Fig. 4. At 20 °C, a value of 111 MPa was measured for the unmodified epoxy polymer, which also reveals that the unmodified epoxy should have the highest strength, if the effect of defects is excluded, when the test is conducted in uniaxial tension.

    "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS = 60,268 km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn’s inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

    "The situation for the 45° case is more interesting (Fig. 9). Here the release is in an intersection and the flow is oblique. In this snapshot, at z=0.23 H the whole plume is blown into the canyon region between the cubes in the y-direction and none in the x-direction. Note that the flow is constantly changing and that this is literally a snapshot. In a different snapshot this might of course be different and on average the plume would be equally likely to be blown into the gap in the x-direction. A little further up, at z=0.52 H, we see that much of the material is now caught in the wake region. A little still comes from the horizontal location of the original source. Higher still, at z=0.80 H, most of the material is concentrated in the region between the cubes. Nothing comes from the horizontal location of the original source. The highest concentration is around the centre of the gap, but somewhat away from the mean location of the core of the recirculation behind the upstream cube. This indicates the possible release of material trapped further down in the recirculation. These visualisations suggest the idea that transfer from the original source location to the wake occurs predominantly at low levels, whereas the re-release of material occurs mainly at higher levels. It would be of interest to test this hypothesis quantitatively in future studies. Above the array, material appears to be coming from the wake region, which therefore acts as a ‘secondary source’.",

These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

    "It has not been reported whether the significantly simplified E8 medium is sufficient to support the survival and proliferation of undifferentiated hPSCs in suspension culture. Thus our studies began by establishing a static suspension culture condition in E8 medium for serial passaging and expansion of hiPSCs. BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007). The cells survived and formed convex dish-shaped aggregates within 24 h due to the gravity force (Fig. 1a). The size of the cell aggregates gradually increased corresponding to the cell number along the culture period. BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7 ± 0.9 fold per passage, 3.7 × 106 fold increase in total with > 99% of the cells being TRA-1–60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c). We also examined the differentiation potential of expanded cells, using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008). We found that under the hematopoiesis-inducing condition, leukocyte-like cells emerged around day 10 (Fig. 1d) with 46.8% ± 1.6% of the cells becoming CD34+CD45+ HPCs (Fig. 1e).

We showed that co-deposition of blended mixtures leads to 60% higher photocurrents than in thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts [37]. Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ we improved their power conversion efficiency by as much as 80%, achieving performance comparable to PTh:PCBM equivalents processed in solution from thermo-cleavable precursors [52]. An enhanced photoresponse results from the favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing, modestly larger grain sizes and increased crystallization of C60. In contrast to most small-molecule blends, annealing-induced phase separation does not lead to formation of microcrystals but rather to a controlled improvement of the donor–acceptor network.

All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use.

    "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (∼33.7 Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive. Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.",

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

    "A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described. This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid. The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.",

    "An energy-based criterion was used to predict debonding of the particles. The method used has been fully described elsewhere [49] and essentially it proposes that the criterion for debonding is based upon the energy released by the debonding process. To obtain the parameters needed for this energy-based criterion, a finite-element analysis modelling study has been used to derive the change in strain-energy arising from the cavitation process, with the addition of the strain-energy stored in the particle prior to debonding. The applied stress used for these simulations was derived from experimental observations. Namely, as implied above, the debonding of the silica nanoparticles from the epoxy matrix polymer appears to take place during the elastic deformation region and, as shown in Table 1, the yield stress for all modified epoxy polymers is approximately equal, irrespective of particle size. It has therefore been assumed that the debonding takes place at an applied uniaxial stress of about 70 MPa, which equates to a hydrostatic stress at the crack tip of about 210 MPa. Thus, the finite-element analysis simulations were analysed for an applied hydrostatic stress of 210 MPa.",

    "The two FTD patients under investigation in this study were part of a longitudinal dementia research program at the Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco. Both had an 8-year history of behavioral changes and memory impairment at the time of tissue collection for this study. One patient, a 67-year-old male with sporadic FTD, tested negative for mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9ORF72. The other patient, a 64-year-old male with a significant family history of dementia, had behavioral variant FTD. MRI in this patient demonstrated severe bifrontal and temporal atrophy associated with gliosis in the frontal lobes (greater on the right). One year later, MRI scans showed progression of atrophy and gliosis. Genetic testing revealed a novel nonsense mutation in GRN, p.S116X (g.4627C > A, c.347C > A), which is predicted to result in a premature stop codon. Both FTD patients had parkinsonism, which is typical of all FTD patients with PGRN mutations. An age-matched subject, a clinically normal 64-year-old male with no mutations in GRN, MAPT, or C9ORF72, served as a control.",

    "Environmental changes associated with the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, ∼56 Ma) have not yet been documented in detail from the North Sea Basin. Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54 °N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments. The CIE onset is identified from organic matter δ13C in exceptional detail within a highly expanded sedimentary sequence. Pollen and spore assemblages analysed in the same samples for the first time allow a reconstruction of possible changes to vegetation on the surrounding landmass. Multiproxy palynological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records demonstrate enhanced halocline stratification and terrigenous deposition well before (103 yrs) the CIE, interpreted as due to either tectonic uplift possibly from a nearby magmatic intrusion, or increased precipitation and fluvial runoff possibly from an enhanced hydrologic cycle. Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM. Palynological evidence indicates a flora dominated by pollen from coastal swamp conifers before the CIE was abruptly replaced with a more diverse assemblage of generalist species including pollen similar to modern alder, fern, and fungal spores. This may have resulted from flooding of coastal areas due to relative sea level rise, and/or ecologic changes forced by climate. A shift towards more diverse angiosperm and pteridophyte vegetation within the early CIE, including pollen similar to modern hickory, documents a long term change to regional vegetation.",

    "In the present study, both aggregate stability and repellency were reduced in month 7; specifically the degree of reduction in repellency was less in the mycorrhizal soils than in the non-mycorrhizal soils. In the mycorrhizal soils, aggregate water repellency was also negatively correlated with bacterial (and fungal) TRF richness but positively correlated with root size and microbial biomass-C. It is likely that mycorrhizal hyphae contributed to the microbial biomass-C measured here which might explain why microbial biomass-C was not a factor in the model explaining repellency in the NM soils. In the mycorrhizal soils the relationship between microbial biomass-C and aggregate stability was negative, whilst it was positive for repellency. The GLM regressions used data for all 7 months but the system was dynamic across the months. For example, aggregate stability was greater in the mycorrhizal soils in month 3, yet repellency increased in months 5 and 7. The positive relationship observed between per cent root length colonised and microbial biomass-C is likely to be the result of increasing hyphal length in the soil, or possibly an enhancement of other microbial species too, since internal AMF root colonisation may not reflect the extraradical hyphal biomass. Aggregate turnover rates range from 4 to 88 days (De Gryze et al. 2005, 2006); an increase in aggregate stability observed here over a 60 day period (from the first to third month harvest) and an increase in aggregate water repellency over a 120 day period (from the first to fifth month harvest) is comparable to that observed by others.",

    "There are several time-scales involved in performance variations of photovoltaic devices. In the short term, there is the direct influence of the environment as discussed in Section 4. In the mid-term there is the Staebler–Wronski effect for a-Si [48,49] or pre-conditioning for CIGS, which affects the annual energy prediction by less than 5% typically and are not further explored here. The effect for CIGS is slightly contradictory as there is no clarity of the time scales involved yet [4,50]. There are also long-term gradual degradation effects which affect all device technologies [51]. In many published discussions there are generalisations of technologies. It is shown below that such a general behaviour was not observed at CREST. The maximum power point data of all devices within an irradiance range of 650–750 W/m2 have been extracted and corrected to 700 W/m2 and 25 °C using bi-linear interpolation. These power values are annotated as P700. This particular irradiance level was chosen as there is a statistically significant number of data points in each month of the year and thus fewer outliers to affect the analysis. The result is shown in Fig. 9 (top graph). To contrast power and energy, the monthly performance ratios are also plotted (bottom graph)Table 2.",

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

Strategies A–C lead to similar generator efficiencies, the two major trends being that increased average wind speed causes a higher generator efficiency while a higher frequency of the wind speed reduces the generator efficiency. In the high wind speed case at low frequencies, the generator efficiency of the reference strategy is similar to that of the other strategies. However, the generator efficiency with the reference strategy is lower at high wind frequencies. This reduced efficiency is due to high resistive loss caused by the high generator torque during the rapid oscillations. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01–0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A–C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss. In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies above 0.003 Hz, the reference strategy causes a too low average tip speed ratio which reduces energy capture, see Figs. 10 and 11.",

For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig. S4). After 8 days in spinner flask followed by 4 days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a).

For in vitro assay, by simply replacing the entire E8 medium with differentiation medium of day-2 spinner flask suspension culture, BC1 and TNC1 aggregates transformed into EBs and started spontaneous differentiation under the stimulation of 10% serum (Supplementary Fig. S4). After 8 days in spinner flask followed by 4 days on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in differentiation medium, cells of all three germ layers could be detected by immunofluorescent staining of specific markers (Fig. 5a). In contrast, undifferentiated hiPSCs on day 0 showed negative staining of all germ markers (data not shown). For in vivo assay, BC1 and TNC1 harvested from suspension culture in spinner flasks were injected into immune-deficient mice and were able to form teratomas containing cells of all germ layers, including glandular epithelium, chondrocytes, and neural rosettes (Fig. 5b).

[47]). If assembly of either the large subunit or the entire ribosome was affected then the distribution of individual ribosomal proteins would change within the gradient profile. On analysis MRPL12 from the patient was substantially decreased in all fractions but detectable in the fractions consistent with mt-LSU; however it was noticeably absent from the free pool (fractions 1 and 2, Fig. 5). This was in contrast to the control that exhibited a pool of free MRPL12, which has been reported to interact with POLRMT [56]. MRPL3 was also slightly reduced in subject cells but remained in fractions consistent with the large subunit. The MRPL12 mutation impacted more modestly on the small ribosomal subunit, with DAP3 apparently unaffected and MRPS18B found in lower amounts only in fractions 4 and 5 but otherwise with similar steady state levels and distribution profile compared to control. Since POLRMT and MRPL12 have been published as interactors, we analyzed both the steady state level and gradient distribution of POLRMT to see if these were affected by the MRPL12 mutation. Overall levels in the subject sample were decreased to 63% of control value (Fig. 5B) but distribution in the gradient appeared largely unaffected with the exception of fraction 11, where levels were lower than control (Fig. 5A bottom panels).",

Where clay mineral values are greater than 10% uncertainty is estimated as better than 5% weight at the 95% confidence level (Hillier, 2003). Clay mineral estimates are shown in Table 1.",

    "The resulting synthetic seismic differences (Fig. 8) of both the 34 °C and 38 °C options look very similar and also show some similarity to the real data, also shown in Fig. 8. The synthetic difference (repeat-base) seismograms from near the top of the reservoir agree reasonably well with the real difference seismograms (repeat-base) for the Ktzi201/2007 and Ktzi200/2007 wells reported by Ivanova et al. (2012). However, obvious disagreements are found at the Ktzi202/2007 well, which may be due to the fact that the velocity model used at this location is not sufficiently correct. Seismic amplitude differences between the 38 °C and 34 °C scenarios correspond to less than 1% of the amplitude values of the baseline (Fig. 8). Since the normalized root mean square (NRMS) differences in the 3D time-lapse data are greater than 10% (Kashubin et al., 2011) these temperature effects in the reservoir will not be resolvable with surface seismic methods at the Ketzin site.",

This may explain the appearance of the very low DEF of heavy-ions at ∼400eV. However, due to the finite gyro-radius effect it is also plausible that the general behaviour of the heavy-ions flowing away from Mars may not change, even when passing an acceleration region. The gyroradius of heavy-ions with energies around ∼10eV at the location of the accelerated electron signature is around 100 km, which is of a similar spatial scale to the horizontal size of a closed crustal magnetic field line at 400 km.

    "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS = 60,268 km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn’s inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

    "The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.",

To demonstrate this we calculated the difference in Vp between both temperature scenarios present at the Ketzin site at the time of the 1st 3D seismic repeat campaign (Ivanova et al., 2012) using Gassmann's equations (1951) for 50% CO2 saturation. The resulting difference between the scenarios in Vp is less than 5 m/s. Considering the uncertainties (e.g. ±5% error in CO2 saturation) in the petrophysical experiments (Kummerow and Spangenberg, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2012) corresponding to ±70 m/s in Vp (Fig. 5), we did not take into account the Vp changes (Fig. 5, Eq.

    "We next addressed whether hESC-derived trigeminal neurons can engraft in the adult mouse CNS and project toward their physiological target. The trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem receive afferent innervation from the trigeminal sensory ganglion that is relayed to the contralateral thalamus. The pons was selected as site for transplantation, because it is surgically accessible and located within proximity of the trigeminal brain stem nuclei that receive afferent input from the trigeminal ganglia. Hence, GFP+ human trigeminal neuron clusters were injected into adult NOD/SCID mice via stereotactic surgery (see Experimental Procedures). Histological analysis 4 weeks after transplantation showed survival of GFP+ human cell graft in the ventral pons (Figure S5E). Although GFP+ cell bodies remained tightly clustered at injection site, GFP+ fibers showed extensive projections into the host brain (n = 6) including the endogenous trigeminal nuclei (Figure S5F). Expression of BRN3A confirmed the sensory neuron identity of the cells (Figure S5G). Graft-derived human fiber bundles (hNCAM+ and GFP+) were observed emanating from the graft core (Figure S5H). These data demonstrate in vivo survival of trigeminal placode derivatives, differentiation along sensory neuron lineage, and the establishment of axonal projections toward relevant endogenous targets in the embryonic chick and adult mouse brain.",

    "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.",

We could not detect any apparent uptake in the other animals or at any other time points (Figure S2). Intriguingly, the serum level of IFN-γ temporarily increased at 2 months after the transplant in three animals (Figure 3C). An immunofluorescence study conducted at 3.5–4 months showed that MHC-II+ cells were more frequently found in allografts than in autografts, especially in the monkey with increased uptake of [11C]PK11195 (Figure 3D, No. 10). The MHC-II staining never overlapped with that of GFP of the donor cells (Figure 3F), whereas it generally overlapped with that of IBA1 (Figure 3G), indicating that MHC-II was expressed by host-derived microglia. Consistently, the number and density of IBA1+ cells were higher in allografts than in autografts (Figures 3E, 3H, and S4C). An increase in the expression of MHC might trigger the recruitment of circulating immune cells, including T cells. An immunofluorescence study revealed that more CD45+ cells (a marker for pan-leukocytes) accumulated in allografts compared with autografts (Figures 3I and 3J). Most of the CD45+ cells were CD3+ T cells, and 60% of them were CD8+ killer T cells (Figures 3K and 3L).

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

    "Over-expression of master regulators for cold tolerance can produce cold-tolerant leaves and photosynthetic apparatus, including tolerance to photoinhibition in winter. Over-expression of two endogenous cold-binding factor/drought responsive element binding (CBF/DREB)1-like genes in rape (B. napus) increased freezing tolerance and improved photochemical efficiency and photosynthetic capacity. These transgenics were less affected by photoinhibition induced by low temperatures and high insolation [99]. Similarly, over-expression of two CBF/DREB genes from Eucalyptus gunnii, a species that can withstand winter temperatures down to −18 °C, improved drought and freezing tolerance of a cold-sensitive Eucalyptus hybrid (E. urophylla × E. grandis) [136].

    "Despite the lack of correlation between aggregate stability and AMF, rapid growth of G. mosseae hyphae suggested by Jansa et al. (2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species. Work by Giovannetti et al. (2001, 2004) demonstrated that AMF hyphae frequently anastamose and could result in a large network of interconnecting hyphae. Within the current experiment, colonisation by G. mosseae resulted in a higher proportion of small soil pores to large ones and reduced distances between neighbouring pores. A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (∼0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001). In contrast, G. intraradices led to soil with a greater number of large pores and all combinations of G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between neighbouring pores. Bearden (2001) concluded, in a study of soil–water characteristics, that AMF hyphae resulted in soils gaining groups of small pores which corroborates the current findings, although it is interesting that different Glomus species affect the size and distance between pores differently. Bearden (2001) used a combination of six Glomus species (including G. mosseae) in her investigation of vertisols. In contrast, Milleret et al. (2009) found no evidence of G. intraradices forming small diameter structural pores and the larger size of the pores relative to the AMF led them to conclude that pore development was an indirect effect of the mycorrhiza. Since the extraradical hyphae had a smaller diameter than the pores, the authors suggested that hyphal penetration of pores induced root exudation and increased microbial activity. The data in the current investigation show that plant roots, possibly by influencing the associated microbial biomass and not colonisation by AMF per se, positively affected aggregate stability. Previous studies (e.g. Bedini et al., 2009) showed that aggregate stability is affected by the plant-fungal system rather than by plant root metabolism. Hallett et al. (2009) performed an elegant experiment in which mycorrhizal-deficient and ‘wild type’ tomato plants were grown in an agricultural field soil amended with G. mosseae and G. intraradices. These authors demonstrated that aggregate stability and porosity were increased in planted soils irrespective of the plant type (and mycorrhizal status) and they conclude that roots drive the stabilisation of soil structure. Their experiment lasted for 84 days and during this time the soil experienced wet–dry cycles which may have encouraged microbial populations to produce polysaccharides which in turn enhanced aggregate production. However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability. Whilst it has been shown before that different AMF species may affect aggregate stability (Schreiner et al., 1997), the focus here is on the effects of the mycelium in addition to the mycorrhiza. No correlations were observed for AMF hyphal abundance and soil physical properties, demonstrating that the differences observed may relate to growth patterns and mycelium architecture rather than density, or perhaps to AMF-specific altered C-exudation since AM fungi are known to produce extracellular soil proteins such as glomalin (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996). The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.",

All materials (cellulose Soxhlet thimbles, silica wool, vials) were cleaned with analytical grade organic solvents prior to use. Any remaining solvent was then removed by evaporation and the dried sediments were transferred to vials. Any calcites (shelly fragments) were removed by placing the samples in 5% HCl overnight before rinsing and drying down. Carbon isotope analysis was also carried out on palynology residues of the >250 μm size fractions dominated by AOM. 13C/12C analyses were performed on 35 samples by combustion in a Costech Elemental Analyser (EA) online to a VG TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer, with δ13C values calculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standards calibrated against NBS-18, NBS-19, and NBS-22.

The resulting difference between the scenarios in Vp is less than 5 m/s.

We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF.

    "Next we apply the multi-phase fluid flow simulations of Lengler et al. (2010) to account for the lateral variability in the petrophysical properties of the storage formation at Ketzin. Lengler et al. (2010) performed simulations on multiple realizations of the Ketzin reservoir using a stochastic Monte Carlo approach in order to take into account the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir characterization at the scale required for fluid flow simulations. In this paper, we use a similar approach, but this time to investigate the impact of the reservoir temperature on the fluid migration and, in turn, on the 4D seismic data. Hydrogeological studies at the Ketzin site (Norden et al., 2010) have shown that a 2D radially symmetric model of the upper part (33 m) of the Stuttgart Formation can be used to interpret the 3D data acquired near the injection well (Fig. 7). This model accounts for the presence of channel sandstones in the reservoir that are the most favorable for CO2 migration and contains effective porosities in the range of 20–25% (Förster et al., 2010). As known from core and log analysis of the injection well Ktzi201/2007 and the first observation well Ktzi200/2007, the reservoir is composed of two high porosity sandstone layers. These layers are separated by a thin strongly cemented sandstone layer (Norden et al., 2010). Since the thickness of this layer is in the decimeter range, it cannot be detected with the seismic wavelengths typically available from surface-seismic measurements. However, this layer is known to be a significant constraint to fluid migration due to its low permeability (Wiese et al., 2010).",

    "The cutoff level of the empirical model is somewhat arbitrary. For neutral species it is partly based on ionization (K10), but this criterion obviously does not apply to ions. With a cutoff level at 5Rp for the ions only, the M7 model yields line-integrated transit depths of 3.9%, 8%, and 5.8% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively, if 40% of silicon is Si2+. These values agree with the observed values to better than 2σ. Similarly, by extending the cutoff level of the C2 model to 5Rp, we obtained transit depths of 3.2%, 6.7%, and 4.6% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively (see Table 2). These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively. The transit depths predicted by the M7 model are higher partly because the mean temperature of 8250 K is higher than the corresponding temperature in the C2 model (Paper I).

The deposition velocity is a scaling factor that affects the transport of species from the bulk atmosphere to the surface in the absence of rain. The deposition velocity is coupled to the gas concentrations computed by chemical kinetics. Following Zahnle et al. (2008), we apply a deposition velocity of 0.02 cm s−1 to all species, with two exceptions. First, the deposition velocities for O2, H2, and CO are set to zero (following Zahnle et al., 2008). Second, all species with a zero deposition velocity in Catling et al. (2010) are prescribed a zero deposition velocity because we consider them to be nonreactive. These species include NO3, N2O5, N2O, CH3O, CH3ONO, CH3ONO2, CH2ONO2, CH3O2, CH3OH, CH2OOH, Cl2, CH2OH, CH2O2, OClO, ClOO, ClONO, ClNO, ClNO2, CH3OCl, Cl2O2, Cl2O, ClO3, and Cl2O4.

    "Next we apply the multi-phase fluid flow simulations of Lengler et al. (2010) to account for the lateral variability in the petrophysical properties of the storage formation at Ketzin. Lengler et al. (2010) performed simulations on multiple realizations of the Ketzin reservoir using a stochastic Monte Carlo approach in order to take into account the high degree of uncertainty in the reservoir characterization at the scale required for fluid flow simulations. In this paper, we use a similar approach, but this time to investigate the impact of the reservoir temperature on the fluid migration and, in turn, on the 4D seismic data. Hydrogeological studies at the Ketzin site (Norden et al., 2010) have shown that a 2D radially symmetric model of the upper part (33 m) of the Stuttgart Formation can be used to interpret the 3D data acquired near the injection well (Fig. 7). This model accounts for the presence of channel sandstones in the reservoir that are the most favorable for CO2 migration and contains effective porosities in the range of 20–25% (Förster et al., 2010). As known from core and log analysis of the injection well Ktzi201/2007 and the first observation well Ktzi200/2007, the reservoir is composed of two high porosity sandstone layers. These layers are separated by a thin strongly cemented sandstone layer (Norden et al., 2010). Since the thickness of this layer is in the decimeter range, it cannot be detected with the seismic wavelengths typically available from surface-seismic measurements. However, this layer is known to be a significant constraint to fluid migration due to its low permeability (Wiese et al., 2010).",

This may explain the appearance of the very low DEF of heavy-ions at ∼400eV. However, due to the finite gyro-radius effect it is also plausible that the general behaviour of the heavy-ions flowing away from Mars may not change, even when passing an acceleration region. The gyroradius of heavy-ions with energies around ∼10eV at the location of the accelerated electron signature is around 100 km, which is of a similar spatial scale to the horizontal size of a closed crustal magnetic field line at 400 km. Therefore, it is possible the heavy-ions do not remain in the acceleration region long enough to experience its effects.",

    "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.",

    "For late Quaternary records, most tephra horizons in sediment cores are dated by (linear) interpolation of 14C dates of carbonates, bulk sediment or organic remains. However, lakes are especially prone to a reservoir effect, due to dissolution of ancient carbonates and/or old organic matter that is washed into the lake from the catchment and incorporated into the sediment. Both phenomena can result in anomalous 14C ages and an offset from the real age of the dated material, which is not necessarily constant through time in the sediment section (Geyh et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2007). This offset from the real age can be of the order of several hundred or even more than a thousand years if bulk sediment or carbonates are dated, and can thus lead to misleading or erroneous age models if it is not taken into account (Geyh et al., 1998; Bertrand et al., 2012). Sediment sections spanning time intervals with multiple tephra layers could therefore easily be miscorrelated if the tephra is not adequately characterised to back up correlations. Appropriate tephra characterisation can potentially also help in evaluating the reservoir effect in a sediment section by providing a tie-point in the age model, provided the age of the tephra is well known from one or more independent sources (e.g., 14C dating on charcoal incorporated in terrestrial deposits, for example the well-constrained 3.00–3.05 ka cal BP Alpehué Pumice (So-A) eruption from Sollipulli; Supplementary Table 1; Naranjo et al., 1993b).",

    "As 22/10a-4 is in the deep (>0.5 km) central part of the basin, it acted as a depocentre and exhibits a Paleocene-Eocene transition sequence that is not only expanded but is also close to being stratigraphically complete. The only evidence for breaks in the succession is minor erosion at the base of thin turbidite sandstones (typically <10 cm). Because these sandstones may contain reworked material, they were not sampled in this study. During the late Paleocene, the basin became restricted following a fall in in the order of 100 m that resulted from regional uplift associated with the proto-Iceland mantle plume in the North Atlantic (see Knox, 1996). This event is evident in 22/10a-4 as a lithologic change from unbedded to bedded mudstone (the Lista and Sele Formation boundary, Fig. 2). Restriction of the basin also led to the establishment of poorly oxygenated bottom waters, as is evident by a shift in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards low diversity low oxygen-tolerant agglutinated species (Knox, 1996). The CIE at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary was accompanied by a relative sea level rise, as documented in southeast England (Powell et al., 1996) and Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011), due to the thermal expansion of sea water and possible melting of ice caps, although the North Sea basin remained restricted as evidenced by the persistence of low oxygen facies in 22/10a-4. The North Sea had a widespread freshwater catchment area, and a halocline was in place from the late Paleocene to early Eocene (Zacke et al., 2009). Therefore, surface water salinity changes in the North Sea Basin provide a sensitive gauge for stratification forced by changes in tectonics and the hydrologic cycle.",

    "The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 ± 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of ∼0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest ⩽1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.",

    "We used three indicators (or proxy measures) to identify persons with depressive symptoms. First, participants responded to the self-administered 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at phases 3, 5, 7, and 9, a screening instrument designed for and widely used in population-based surveys and trials (26). Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27). In a more recent validation using a subgroup of 274 participants aged 58 to 70 in 2010, the sensitivity and specificity of GHQ symptom caseness against diagnosed depressive episodes based on a structured psychiatric interview were 80% and 81%, respectively.",

    "Despite the lack of correlation between aggregate stability and AMF, rapid growth of G. mosseae hyphae suggested by Jansa et al. (2008) might be expected to result in alterations in soil structure relative to hyphae of other slower growing species. Work by Giovannetti et al. (2001, 2004) demonstrated that AMF hyphae frequently anastamose and could result in a large network of interconnecting hyphae. Within the current experiment, colonisation by G. mosseae resulted in a higher proportion of small soil pores to large ones and reduced distances between neighbouring pores. A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (∼0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001). In contrast, G. intraradices led to soil with a greater number of large pores and all combinations of G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between neighbouring pores. Bearden (2001) concluded, in a study of soil–water characteristics, that AMF hyphae resulted in soils gaining groups of small pores which corroborates the current findings, although it is interesting that different Glomus species affect the size and distance between pores differently. Bearden (2001) used a combination of six Glomus species (including G. mosseae) in her investigation of vertisols. In contrast, Milleret et al. (2009) found no evidence of G. intraradices forming small diameter structural pores and the larger size of the pores relative to the AMF led them to conclude that pore development was an indirect effect of the mycorrhiza. Since the extraradical hyphae had a smaller diameter than the pores, the authors suggested that hyphal penetration of pores induced root exudation and increased microbial activity. The data in the current investigation show that plant roots, possibly by influencing the associated microbial biomass and not colonisation by AMF per se, positively affected aggregate stability. Previous studies (e.g. Bedini et al., 2009) showed that aggregate stability is affected by the plant-fungal system rather than by plant root metabolism. Hallett et al. (2009) performed an elegant experiment in which mycorrhizal-deficient and ‘wild type’ tomato plants were grown in an agricultural field soil amended with G. mosseae and G. intraradices. These authors demonstrated that aggregate stability and porosity were increased in planted soils irrespective of the plant type (and mycorrhizal status) and they conclude that roots drive the stabilisation of soil structure. Their experiment lasted for 84 days and during this time the soil experienced wet–dry cycles which may have encouraged microbial populations to produce polysaccharides which in turn enhanced aggregate production. However in the current study, individual AMF species and combinations of co-occurring AMF species caused short-term effects on pore dynamics which may result in long-term impacts on porosity and aggregate stability. Whilst it has been shown before that different AMF species may affect aggregate stability (Schreiner et al., 1997), the focus here is on the effects of the mycelium in addition to the mycorrhiza. No correlations were observed for AMF hyphal abundance and soil physical properties, demonstrating that the differences observed may relate to growth patterns and mycelium architecture rather than density, or perhaps to AMF-specific altered C-exudation since AM fungi are known to produce extracellular soil proteins such as glomalin (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996). The data presented here demonstrate that different AMF species within the same genus may have contrasting effects on soil pore characteristics which could alter the micro-physical habitat for other soil organisms.",

    "The steady state level of MRPL12 in the subject's fibroblasts was reduced to 30% of control value (Fig. 4A and B). The mt-LSU protein ICT1 was also decreased (~ 30% of control values) as was MRPL3 (by 37%) suggesting that a consequence of the MRPL12 mutation is a global defect in assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU). In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

    "Another important finding is that, in spite of the immune responses mounted by the host brain, a substantial number of TH+ cells survived in the allografts. This is consistent with previous clinical reports of human fetal cell transplantation. Postmortem analyses of the patients revealed robust survival of DA neurons in spite of the fact that numerous immune cells were present around the graft (Kordower et al., 1997). In two double-blind clinical trials, immunosuppressive drugs were never used (Freed et al., 2001) or were withdrawn after 6 months (Olanow et al., 2003). In these cases, the cells from multiple fetuses were used without HLA matching, but more than 50,000 TH+ cells had survived after several years. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) study in vitro showed that the expression of MHC-I increased in response to IFN-γ, but the expression level was still 1/10 that of untreated monkey peripheral blood cells (Figure 2B). The in vivo studies revealed that the serum level of IFN-γ increased at 2 months, and CD45+ cells (including CD8+ cells) accumulated in the allografts 3.5–4 months after the transplant. On the other hand, the levels of INF-γ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in both the serum and CSF were below the limit of detection by ELISA (data not shown). An immunofluorescence study did not reveal any apparent expression of MHC-I by the grafted cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, it is possible that the immune response in the primate brain was not strong enough to reject all of the donor cells. These findings closely correlate with the results of previous murine experiments (Hudson et al., 1994; Shinoda et al., 1995). To apply our findings to a more clinically relevant setting, we investigated the expression of HLA-I during neural differentiation of human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs by qPCR (Figure S4D). The expression level was 1/100 compared with that of human peripheral blood cells in both hESCs and iPSCs, and it was similarly elevated in response to IFN-γ. It is difficult to precisely compare immunogenicity in monkeys with that in humans, but the low expression level of MHC-I by the donor cells may account for the mild rejection in both monkey and human neural transplantation.",

Vp and ρ were vertically averaged from the logs to remove high frequency fluctuations.

The resulting Vs model was linearly interpolated to the injection well using the interpreted lithological horizons after Kling (2011). The input wavelet was extracted from the 3D seismic baseline data (Juhlin et al., 2007) (Fig. 4), yielding a dominant frequency of 40 Hz.

These values agree with the observed values to better than 2σ. Similarly, by extending the cutoff level of the C2 model to 5Rp, we obtained transit depths of 3.2%, 6.7%, and 4.6% in the C II 1334.5 Å, C II 1335.7 Å, and Si III lines, respectively (see Table 2). These values deviate from the observed values by 2σ, 0.9σ, and 2.6σ, respectively. The transit depths predicted by the M7 model are higher partly because the mean temperature of 8250 K is higher than the corresponding temperature in the C2 model (Paper I). This also leads to the higher Si2+/Si+ ratio that we used here.",

    "It has not been reported whether the significantly simplified E8 medium is sufficient to support the survival and proliferation of undifferentiated hPSCs in suspension culture. Thus our studies began by establishing a static suspension culture condition in E8 medium for serial passaging and expansion of hiPSCs. BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007). The cells survived and formed convex dish-shaped aggregates within 24 h due to the gravity force (Fig. 1a). The size of the cell aggregates gradually increased corresponding to the cell number along the culture period. BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7 ± 0.9 fold per passage, 3.7 × 106 fold increase in total with > 99% of the cells being TRA-1–60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c). We also examined the differentiation potential of expanded cells, using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008). We found that under the hematopoiesis-inducing condition, leukocyte-like cells emerged around day 10 (Fig. 1d) with 46.8% ± 1.6% of the cells becoming CD34+CD45+ HPCs (Fig. 1e).

    "At room temperature, the fracture surfaces of the S-CSR particle-modified polymers also showed crack forking and feather markings. However, these fracture surfaces are rougher than those of the unmodified epoxy, and scanning electron micrographs of the deformation zone for the 10 wt% and 20 wt% S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers are shown in Fig. 13. The fracture surfaces are covered with cavitated S-CSR particles, which can be identified as the circular features in Fig. 13. The cavitation process causes the originally solid rubber particles to deform into a rubbery shell surrounding a void. The mean diameter of these cavities was measured to be 0.296 μm. This is significantly larger than the mean diameter of the S-CSR particles measured from the AFM images, which was 0.18 μm. This observation clearly reveals that plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer has followed cavitation of the S-CSR particles. This is one of the main toughening mechanisms for such thermoset polymers toughened by the presence of well-dispersed rubber particles. Essentially, the cavitation of the particle creates voids which relieve the triaxial stress-state ahead of the crack tip and so enable plastic void growth to occur far more readily in the epoxy polymer. Cavitation, as opposed to particle debonding, will occur when the rubber particle is strongly bonded to the surrounding polymer. Indeed, based on the FEG-SEM observations, the core to shell adhesion must also be relatively high for the S-CSR particles, as no debonding is observed. For the low-temperature results, the fracture surfaces of the particle-modified polymers are very similar to the samples tested at room temperature, see Figs. 14 and 15. Indeed, all of the S-CSR particles cavitated, even at −109 °C, although the size of the cavities is reduced at low temperatures, which indicates a lesser extent of plastic void growth in the epoxy polymer.",

Since the computational domain is symmetric and the simulation time covered one full period, the optimised layout is expected to be symmetric in the x-direction. The numerical solution, shown in Fig. 10b, indeed shows an almost symmetric result. The turbine alignment consists of two distorted ∨ shapes whose open ends face the in/-outflow boundaries. Similar to the previous example, an interpretation of this alignment is to divert the stream towards the corner of the ∨ where turbines can extract large amounts of power.

Due to the insolubility of PTh, no accurate direct measurement of the molecular weight could be made (nor was this value indicated by the manufacturer), however a combination of different techniques in our previous work [37] suggested that the evaporated PTh is near its effective conjugation length (20–25 monomer units, Eg≈2.0 eV), which corresponds to Mw~1500–2000 g mol−1.",

In order to estimate the effect of the MRPL12 mutation on assembly of the whole ribosome, we also tested three proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU), MRPS18B, MRPS25 and DAP3. These were modestly decreased with levels of ~ 60–80% of control (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, 16S and 12S rRNA levels were decreased by 35% and 22% respectively (Fig. 7A). Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

    "It has not been reported whether the significantly simplified E8 medium is sufficient to support the survival and proliferation of undifferentiated hPSCs in suspension culture. Thus our studies began by establishing a static suspension culture condition in E8 medium for serial passaging and expansion of hiPSCs. BC1 cells cultured on E8 feeder-free conditions (E8-Matrigel or E8-VNT-N) for at least 3 passages were seeded as a single cell suspension in E8 medium supplemented with Y27632 on the first day (Watanabe et al., 2007). The cells survived and formed convex dish-shaped aggregates within 24 h due to the gravity force (Fig. 1a). The size of the cell aggregates gradually increased corresponding to the cell number along the culture period. BC1 cells expanded in static suspension in E8 medium with an average rate of 3.7 ± 0.9 fold per passage, 3.7 × 106 fold increase in total with > 99% of the cells being TRA-1–60+ after 13 passages (Fig. 1b,c). We also examined the differentiation potential of expanded cells, using the spin-EB method (Ng et al., 2008, 2005; Yu et al., 2008). We found that under the hematopoiesis-inducing condition, leukocyte-like cells emerged around day 10 (Fig. 1d) with 46.8% ± 1.6% of the cells becoming CD34+CD45+ HPCs (Fig. 1e). These results indicate that undifferentiated hiPSCs can be expanded in suspension in E8 medium supplemented with one-day treatment of Y27632, and retain their differentiation potential.",

(2) The cortical (Fig. 1C) and subcortical masks with pre-defined brain regions from the standard atlas were transferred to the individual's headspace (Fig. 1D), using the inverse of the transformation obtained in the first step: the Harvard-Oxford Atlas, part of the FSL software with masks of 96 cortical gray-matter regions (48 regions in each hemisphere), 21 sub-cortical regions, and cerebellum, was used. (3) The regional masks were down-sampled to a cubic source grid with voxels of 5 mm per side (Fig. 1E). (4) VESTAL MEG source imaging used the source grid from step 3. This step permits group-based analyses. In the shown example, MEG responses evoked by S1 localized to left and right Heschl's gyri (Fig. 1F). (5) Finally, for regions of interest (ROIs), the source time course was obtained by summing activity from all ROI voxels.

    "It is important to note that the divalent cation Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.097 nm [22], which leads to a number of speculative points; (1) the diameter of the cation is smaller than the internal cavity of the amylose helix (double or single; ca. 0.4–1.0 nm), which itself is presumably flexible under the synthesis conditions to accommodate introduction of the Cd2+ into its hydrophobic cavity (perhaps occupying micropores (Table 1); (2) the diameter is also approximately the same length as the (OH) H-bonding distances (i.e. 0.19–0.21 nm) [23] between adjacent glucose residues that form the amylose helix (believed to be key to the formation of the porous polysaccharide phase); [15,24] consequently coordination of Cd2+ may stabilise an alternative metastable polysaccharide confirmation(s), gel state and in turn expanded surface properties. It is thought that at low loadings (e.g. CdS3), Cd2+ is adsorbed initially within the (smaller) pores of MS, leading to a nanoconfinement of the forming CdS phase. CdS will nucleate here presumably according to a pseudo-epitaxial growth, generating confined, amorphous nanoparticles or “seeds” (as indicated from XRD data). As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase. As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase. This is an interesting observation and may lead to the synthesis of a variety of polysaccharide/inorganic hybrids and templated materials, as well as the potential to utilise ionic potential to direct textural properties of polysaccharide gels and associated porous xero- and aerogels.",

    "A method for preparing CdS nanoparticles within the porous confines of a mesoporous starch gel is described. This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading. The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies. Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading. The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading. A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid. The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.",

Previous work established the existence of coherent dependence clusters and detailed the functionalities of the visualization tool. This paper extends previous work in many ways, firstly by introducing an efficient hashing algorithm for slice approximation. This improves on the precision of previous slice approximation from 78% to 95%, resulting in precise and accurate clustering. The coherent cluster existence study is extended to empirically validate the results by considering 30 production programs. Additional case studies show that coherent clusters can help reveal the structure of a program and identify structural defects. We also introduce the notion of inter-cluster dependence which will form the base of reverse engineering efforts in future. Finally, we also present studies which show the lack of correlation between coherent clusters and bug fixes and show that coherent clusters remain surprisingly stable during system evolution.",

As ηnet ranges from 0.1 to 1 (with the average solar flux), the velocity at the upper boundary increases from 2.6 km s−1 to 25 km s−1. However, the velocity does not increase linearly with stellar flux or without a bound – in the 100× case the velocity at the upper boundary is only 30 km s−1. An interesting qualitative feature of the solutions is that the sonic point moves to a lower altitude with increasing heating efficiency or stellar flux. With ηnet = 0.1 the isothermal sonic point is located above the upper boundary whereas with ηnet = 1 it is located at 4Rp. This behavior is related to the temperature gradient and it is discussed further in Section 3.1.3. Basically the sonic point, when it exists, moves further from the planet as the high altitude heating rate decreases.",

    "The H/H+ transition in the MC09 model occurs near 1.4Rp. If we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model, the H/H+ transition moves higher to 2–3Rp. This is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere, extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak. This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization. With these conditions, the H/H+ transition moves up to 3.4Rp, in agreement with the C2 model. We conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by Murray-Clay et al. (2009) and Guo (2011) lead to an underestimated overall density of H and an overestimated ion fraction. Thus their density profiles yield a H Lyman α transit depth of the order of 2–3% i.e., not significantly higher than the visible transit depth.",

Therefore, the tidal period was defined to be P ≡ 10 min, which resulted in a tidal range of ±12 m. The simulation time was set to one full tidal period with a time step of Δt = 12 s.

Core 22/10a-4 is located in the central part of the basin (Figs. 1 and S1) and is therefore disconnected from many marginal marine processes that could mask oceanographic signals (e.g. tidal or storm-induced erosion and slumping). Paleobathymetry estimates in the North Sea during the Paleocene and Eocene are difficult to constrain accurately, as the extant benthic foraminifera present in the Paleogene are found today living between 200 and >1000 m water depth (Gradstein et al., 1992), and are controlled predominantly by substrate and bottom water properties. However using a number of paleoecologic micropaleontology methods together (Gillmore et al., 2001), along with 2D structural restoration (Kjennerud and Sylta, 2001), broad agreement was found and central parts of the northern North Sea appear to have had paleodepths of >0.5 km in the earliest Eocene near 22/10a-4 (Kjennerud and Gillmore, 2003, Fig. S1).",

Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear.

    "The detections of atomic hydrogen, heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet (EGP) HD209458b constrain the composition, temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere. Thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions. We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles. This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium. The composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere. We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 μbar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level. We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+. This means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates. We show that, as expected, H and O remain mostly neutral up to at least 3Rp, whereas both C and Si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes. We also explore the temperature and velocity profiles, and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies. Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU. We use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere.",

    "S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae are the most common pathogens implicated in OME, and all are capable of forming biofilms [33,42]. However, rather than focusing just on those three bacteria, this study cultured effusions on a wide range of different media for prolonged time periods in order to capture as many isolates as possible. Interestingly, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Veillonella spp. and S. aureus were the three commonest pathogens isolated in this study. CoNS were long thought to be non-pathogenic commensals, but with the recognition of their biofilm-forming capacity have emerged as the leading cause of biomaterials-related infection [43,43]. S. lugdunensis, isolated here on three occasions, in particular has been implicated in endocarditis, wound infection, and implant-related infection as well as otitis media, behaving more like S. aureus than other CoNS [45]. Other CoNS have also been previously implicated in otitis media, with a recent study finding that they account for 60% of bacteria isolated from OME [46,47]. Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe that inhabits the mouth and upper respiratory tract, forms biofilms [48] and has previously been found in middle ear disease [49,50]. S. aureus also forms biofilms and has been identified in middle ear disease [51,52]. Although most of the bacteria in Table 2 have previously been isolated in middle ear disease, to the best of the authors’ knowledge Flavimonas oryzihabitans, Vibrio metschnikovii and Gemella haemolysans have not been implicated previously.",

    "We next make several assumptions to calculate the concentration of salts that have accumulated in the soil during the Amazonian eon. We first assume that perchloric acid, sulfate aerosols, nitric acid and pernitric acid have accumulated at a uniform rate. This assumption is valid because the lack of aqueous minerals and very low weathering rates tell us the Amazonian eon on Mars has been characterized by a climate and atmosphere not greatly different from today (Bibring et al., 2006). We next assume a range of soil mixing depths so that salts are distributed throughout the soil column. According to Zent (1998), small post-Noachian impactors have churned the soil on Mars to a 1/e mixing depth of 0.51–0.85 m. Taking three e-folding depths, the range would be 1.5–2.6 m depth, with a mean ∼2 m. The last assumption we make is that the soil density is 1 g cm−3 (Moore and Jakosky, 1989). Using these assumptions, we calculate the concentrations of anions in the soil for the nominal model and report them in Table 4. These anions must be combined into salts. For perchlorate, the salts may be Mg(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 as discussed earlier. The dominant nitrogen-bearing salt is unknown.",

Our findings on diagnosed vascular disease support current clinical guidelines to screen patients with coronary heart disease or stroke for depressive symptoms. However, although the stroke risk score was associated with depressive symptoms before the age of 65, we found little evidence to suggest that standard clinical information on preclinical vascular risk status would be helpful in the prediction of depressive symptoms after the age of 65 years. Thus, extending screening of incident later-life depression to include those identified as having a high risk of developing vascular disease was not supported by this study.",

The section of 22/10a-4 analysed in this study is from 2605 m to 2634 m (core depth), chosen because this part of the core is predominantly in claystone facies and provides a greatly expanded section over the onset of the CIE (Figs. 2 and 3).

    "Three different methods were used to recover sediment cores in 2010. The upper 0.8 m of sediments were recovered using a freeze-coring technique (Renberg and Hansson, 1993). This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4). Sandy sediment was recovered in the bottom of GD4, equivalent to a sediment depth between 11.8 m and 11.5 m and it proved impossible to penetrate through this material with the available equipment.",

Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF.

Since porin indicated that there was no compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and staining of the mitochondrial network with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester showed no significant alteration in amount or distribution of mitochondria (AR and ZCL unpublished observation) we conclude that the MRPL12 mutation destabilizes the protein resulting in less mt-LSU and to a lesser extent of the small subunit.",

As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

    "By integrating seismic modeling and multiphase fluid flow simulations, we have estimated the impact of the reservoir temperature on the 4D seismic data from Ketzin. We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 °C and the other at 38 °C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).",

    "Three different methods were used to recover sediment cores in 2010. The upper 0.8 m of sediments were recovered using a freeze-coring technique (Renberg and Hansson, 1993). This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4). Sandy sediment was recovered in the bottom of GD4, equivalent to a sediment depth between 11.8 m and 11.5 m and it proved impossible to penetrate through this material with the available equipment.",

    "Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-based gene-targeting method, we inserted the gene-encoding GFP into the SOX2 locus in H9 hESCs (Figure 1A). Proper homologous recombination led to the replacement of the SOX2 open reading frame with that of GFP and a neomycin selection cassette (SV40-Neo). After infection with rAAV and G418 drug selection, a total of 36 clones were expanded and screened by Southern blotting for homologous recombination events. Among these clones, 26 (72%) were found to carry the GFP-Neo cassette in the SOX2 locus (Figure S1A available online). No clones in which both SOX2 alleles were disrupted were isolated. Our subsequent analysis focused on one of these clones, clone 23 (hSOX2-23). We confirmed appropriate gene targeting in this clone using multiple restriction digests followed by Southern blotting (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). We did not observe nontargeted insertions of the rAAV sequences, and cells exhibited a normal karyotype (data not shown). Flow cytometry of hSOX2-23 revealed that the majority of the cells expressed GFP (Figure 1C). By comparison, a drug-selected clone, hSOX2-25, which was negative for targeted insertion (Figure S1A), showed no detectable GFP (Figure S2A). Despite only having one copy of SOX2, hSOX2-23 had similar levels of SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG expression as hSOX2-25 and wild-type (WT) hESCs (Figure S2B). Moreover, the percentage of GFP-positive (GFP+) cells in hSOX2-23 was constant over more than 20 passages. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of hSOX2-23 showed that 100% of GFP+ cells expressed SOX2 protein (Figure S2C). Additionally, hSOX2-23 colonies had characteristic hESC morphology (Figure S2D) and expressed markers of the undifferentiated state, such as NANOG (Figure S2E). These results show that this rAAV-based gene-targeting method can be used to efficiently disrupt genes by homologous recombination. In addition, the SOX2-GFP hESC marker line can be used to monitor SOX2 expression in undifferentiated hESCs.",

The numerical solution, shown in Fig. 10b, indeed shows an almost symmetric result. The turbine alignment consists of two distorted ∨ shapes whose open ends face the in/-outflow boundaries. Similar to the previous example, an interpretation of this alignment is to divert the stream towards the corner of the ∨ where turbines can extract large amounts of power.

    "We found that the dense layers of brash produced by windrowing significantly reduced the amount of natural regeneration. Windrows could be up to a metre high and several metres wide, producing a physical barrier that prevented seedling establishment and creating regions with little or no regeneration. While we might expect seedlings from larger seeded species like rowan (200,000 seeds weigh 1 kg) to have an advantage over seedlings from smaller seeded species such as birch (5.9 million seeds weigh 1 kg) in growing through brash (Leishman and Westoby, 1994) we found no significant difference between the proportion of rowan in windrows and interrows. Furthermore, previous studies have found that where grazing pressure is high, brash (Truscott et al., 2004) and coarse woody debris (Smit et al., 2012) can help protect seedlings from browsing. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from our study as only a single site (U15) recorded significant browsing. The low incidence of browsing at our study sites (grazing pressure was controlled) means that grazing is unlikely to limit regeneration (Palmer et al., 2004; Olesen and Madsen, 2008; Yamagawa et al., 2010).",

    "The abrupt onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (∼33.7 Ma, Oi1) is linked to declining atmospheric pCO2 levels, yet the mechanisms that forced pCO2 decline remain elusive. Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment. Diatom and sponge silicon isotope ratios (δ30Si) are here combined for the first time to reconstruct the late Eocene–early Oligocene ocean silicon cycle and provide new insight into the role of diatom productivity in Antarctic glaciation. At ODP site 1090 in the Southern Ocean, a 0.6‰ rise in diatom δ30Si through the late Eocene documents increasing diatom silicic acid utilisation with high, near modern values attained by the earliest Oligocene. A concomitant 1.5‰ decline in sponge δ30Si at ODP site 689 on the Maud Rise tracks an approximate doubling of intermediate depth silicic acid concentration in the high southern latitudes. Intermediate depth silicic acid concentration peaked at ∼31.5 Ma, coincident with the final establishment of a deepwater pathway through the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage. These results suggest that upwelling intensification related to the spin-up of a circum-Antarctic current may have driven late Eocene diatom proliferation. Organic carbon burial associated with higher diatom abundance and export provides a mechanism that can account for pCO2 drawdown not only at, but also prior to, Antarctic glaciation as required by a pCO2 ‘threshold’ mechanism for ice sheet growth.",

It appears that only BS1 was recorded in this image sequence, perhaps because the filter penetration depth is too shallow to see the apparently deeper BS2 feature, which should have crossed the central meridian about 30 min after BS1.

The remainder of this section looks at how the clustering profile is affected by bug fixes. Fig. 20 shows individual SCGs for each version of barcode. As coherent clusters are dependent on both backward and forward slices, such clusters will be more sensitive to changes in dependences within the program. The SCGs show that from the initial version barcode-0.90 there were two coherent clusters in the system. The smaller one is around 10% of the code while the larger is around 40% of the code. As the system evolved and went through various modifications and enhancements, the number of clusters and the profile of the clusters remained consistent other than its scaled growth with the increase in program size. It is also evident that during evolution of the system, the enhancement code or newly added code formed part of the larger cluster.

Since the premise of the investigation was to quantify the relationship between biological richness and soil structural changes over time, the soils were not pre-incubated prior to the start of the experiment. Therefore, microbial communities were allowed to develop during the course of the 7 month experiment either in the presence of mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots, or in unplanted soil, thereby allowing root associated changes in community development to be measured. Others, for example Griffiths et al. (2001) and Wertz et al.

    "The magnitudes of the friction factors for the two beaches are very similar over the majority of the swash cycle. This may be somewhat surprising since one would expect higher friction factors for the rougher beach. (For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity. The boundary layer development is likely to play a significant role and its effect can be observed in the results during the uprush. At x = 0.072 m the boundary layer has developed to only a limited extent, so the friction factors for the two beaches are very close. Further up the slope, beyond x = 2.377 m, the friction factors are higher for the coarser 8.4 mm beach. The increase in friction factor as flow reversal is approached is consistent with cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is increasing with decreasing Reynolds number and higher relative roughness. In contrast, cf behaviour during the early stage of the backwash is different from cf behaviour in uniform, steady flow in that cf is initially low, despite the Reynolds number being low and the relative roughness being high. Somewhat later, cf values for the 8.4 mm beach catch up on the values for the 1.3 mm beach and then become higher than the 1.3 mm beach values, but only for locations higher up the beach. At the two lowest locations on the beach cf values are surprisingly similar during the backwash. This means that the boundary layer development is not sufficient to explain cf behaviour throughout the whole swash cycle.",

    "The first panel of Fig. 1 shows an example of a peaked electron distribution. The time interval of the ELS spectrogram is 12 min, revealing a clear “inverted-V” structure over a 2-min interval at the centre of the spectrogram. The DEF energy spectrum at the right shows a positive gradient below the energy of the peak, which is at approximately 60 eV. This corresponds to a peak of similar energy when the energy spectrum is plotted in PSD, but is not shown here. By comparing the energy spectrum of the electron feature to those from the different regions around Mars we find the origin is most likely from the solar wind. Comparing to the modelled Maxwellian distributions show the presence of an accelerated peak as well as an added contribution of heated electrons. This indicates the electron feature could be some way between penetrating solar wind and magnetosheath electrons. Evidence of electrons being accelerated and heated has been found in previous analysis of “inverted-V” electrons and is observed as preferably transverse to the magnetic field at low altitudes (Lundin et al., 2006b; Dubinin et al., 2009).",

    "For Na, Al, K and Fe, the lowest bed inventory of 4.5 kg resulted in a concentration in the flue gas which was less than that of the blank sample, values which then increased for the higher bed inventories. This suggests that a certain amount of these elements is being absorbed, perhaps by the sorbent in the case of Fe, or by the reactor itself. In the case of P, decreased values compared to the blank were found for bed inventories of 4.5 kg and 13 kg, but an increased value for 6 kg inventory. However, the values are very low at <0.01 ppm and this anomalous result may be due to analytical errors.

    "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS = 60,268 km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn’s inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252 km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system. The Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since July 2004, has flown by Enceladus 14 times between 2005 and 2010. Data from Cassini instrument teams identified a plume of water geysers above the so called “tigerstripes” on the south pole of the moon (Dougherty et al., 2006; Porco et al., 2006). This discovery is one of the most important findings to better understand the saturnian magnetosphere. The material released in the form of water gas, ice molecules and dust (Waite et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006) from those geysers is the main source of the E-ring and the neutral torus and is the major plasma source of water group ions in the magnetosphere. A summary of Enceladus findings from Cassini measurements is very well presented by Spencer et al. (2009).",

    "For cell differentiation, FAP-specific iPS cells were cultured with serial changes of media as shown in Fig. 3A. To test whether FAP-specific iPS cells can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, we analyzed several markers via real-time PCR analysis on Day 5 (D5), D13 and D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells (Fig. 3B). A decrease in expression of the pluripotency marker Oct3/4 was accompanied by differentiation of FAP-specific iPS cells. Expression of the endoderm marker Sox17 was observed on D5 differentiation and decreased gradually after the medium was changed to hepatic differentiation medium on D7 (Fig. 3B). The hepatic progenitor marker AFP and the mature hepatocyte marker ALB were obviously expressed on D13 and D20. In addition, immunocytochemical analyses showed Sox17 expression on D5, both HNF-4α and AFP expression on D13, and ALB cytoplasmic staining on D20 (Fig. 3C). Quantitative imaging analysis revealed that approximately 78 ± 0.6% of cells were Sox17-positive on D5 and approximately 88 ± 1.1% of cells were AFP-positive on D13 and approximately 29 ± 0.9% of cells were ALB-positive on D20 (Fig. 3D). The ALB secretion in the media of differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells on D20 was approximately 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3E). Moreover, these D20 differentiated FAP-specific iPS cells were also periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, indicating cytoplasmic glycogen storage (Fig. 3F).

    "The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Phoenix Lander provided in situ measurements of the composition of soluble salts in the martian soil. Soluble sulfate was present at 1.3 ± 0.5 wt.% (Kounaves et al., 2010b), along with cations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The most surprising result was the presence of perchlorate (ClO4-) at an inferred concentration in the soil of ∼0.5 wt.% (Hecht et al., 2009; Kounaves et al., 2010a). The dominance of Mg(ClO4)2 is consistent with simulations of evaporation and freezing at the Phoenix landing site (Marion et al., 2010); however, further analysis of data from the WCL suggests that Ca(ClO4)2 may be the dominant form of perchlorate (Kounaves et al., 2012). The perchlorate-sensitive electrode in the WCL experiment was also sensitive to nitrate, but it was 1000 times more sensitive to perchlorate. Thus, the methodology precluded the detection of nitrate because the signal would have required a mass of nitrate that exceeded the mass of the sample (Hecht et al., 2009). Recently, the MSL mission has also confirmed the presence of perchlorate using pyrolysis as part of the SAM experiment (Steininger et al., 2013). Specifically, pyrolysis showed release of chloromethane and O2 from heated soil samples at the Rocknest location, which is consistent with the decomposition of perchlorate (Sutter et al., 2013). If all of the evolved O2 was released from perchlorate, then the samples contained a comparable amount of perchlorate to the samples at the Phoenix landing site (Leshin et al., 2013). Furthermore, reanalysis of the Viking thermal volatilization experiments suggest ⩽1.6% perchlorate at both Viking 1 and Viking 2 landing sites (Navarro-Gonzalez et al., 2010); however, this has been subject to some debate (Biemann and Bada, 2011). Native perchlorate has also recently been measured in the martian meteorite EETA79001, albeit at a level <1 ppm by mass (Kounaves et al., 2014). Given the various locations of possible detection, perchlorate appears to be ubiquitous on the martian surface.",

    "Observed deviations from the typical, plasma-absorbing interaction region profile may explain some differences. These deviations do not necessarily mean the main interaction mode at Rhea is not plasma absorption. For instance, Simon et al. (2012) demonstrates that the combination of low magnetosonic Mach number and the high plasma beta values of Rhea’s space environment amplifies interaction features which for other plasma absorbers (e.g. Tethys, Dione, Earth’s Moon) are barely detectable. One of these features is a stronger, flow-aligned magnetic field component perturbation, which gives rise to mass-loading-like interaction signatures. Such structures may also complicate electron drifts, but to what extent it is uncertain. Similarly, the high plasma beta makes surface charging more important for Rhea compared to the other Saturnian moons (Roussos et al., 2010). Furthermore, recent developments in the study of Earth’s Moon interaction with the solar wind indicate that the standard picture for a lunar-type interaction may be too simplified: processes, such as the entry of exospheric pick-up ions in the center of the wake, backscattering on the surface and self-pick up of ambient plasma ions, appear to also have an impact on the wake dynamics (Halekas et al., 2011). For instance, the self-pick up process has been shown to lead to enhanced ULF wave activity in the lunar, at least 10% of the time (Nakagawa et al., 2012). Whether a similar process is important the inferred instability at Rhea is questionable, as the latter appears to operate continuously.",

The mass loss rate in our models is Ṁ>107kgs-1 and thus O is dragged along to high altitudes by H.

We studied two cases, one where the injection was performed at 34 °C and the other at 38 °C. Results from the multiphase fluid flow simulations show that the difference between the two cases is small for the CO2 migration. Likewise, the temperature does not affect significantly the seismic amplitude response, although the CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher temperature case. The difference in CO2 density between 34 °C and 38 °C decreases with decreasing pressure and, therefore, with increasing distance from the injection well. Therefore, the modeled time-lapse seismic differences for the two temperature scenarios is minor regarding the qualitative analysis of the 4D seismic data from the Ketzin CO2 storage site (Fig. 8).",

We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II). Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF. The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear. Our model also predicts the possibility of observable polar emission (region II/I boundary) of ~15kR for both cases ES and EF. However, this region is strongly dependent on the plasma flow model used and poorly constrained by observations.",

According to the experimental results as shown in Table 9 and Fig. 4, we find that the computational time of both static (Algorithm 1) and incremental (Algorithm 3) algorithms are increasing monotonically along with the increasing of insert ratios. It is easy to get the incremental algorithm is always faster than the static algorithm when the inserting ratio increases from 10% to 100% according to Fig. 4(a)–(e).

    "In upland areas of Great Britain, large tracts of non-native conifer plantations have been established on poor quality agricultural land. There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species. We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120 m to 380 m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers. Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000 stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations. Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.",

    "Three different methods were used to recover sediment cores in 2010. The upper 0.8 m of sediments were recovered using a freeze-coring technique (Renberg and Hansson, 1993). This core recovers a thin (approximately 1 cm) vertical slab of relatively undisturbed sediment and was only used for correlation purposes. The freezing technique physically disturbs the micro-structure of unconsolidated sediments and paleomagnetic sub-samples were not obtained from it. Five cores for paleomagnetic measurements were recovered using a rod-operated fixed-piston corer described by Snowball and Sandgren (2002). This system recovers complete 4.8 m long cores of sediment in PVC tubes of either 60 or 63 mm internal diameter, although it is not oriented to a geographic azimuth for practical reasons. This system provided four overlapping cores for paleomagnetic reconstructions to a sediment depth of 8 m (GD0a, GP1, GP2 and GP4. GP3 failed due to an insecure piston). A cable operated Uwitec “Niederreiter” percussion piston corer (three metre long drives) was subsequently used to recover sediments to depth of approximately 11.8 m (drives GD1–GD4). Sandy sediment was recovered in the bottom of GD4, equivalent to a sediment depth between 11.8 m and 11.5 m and it proved impossible to penetrate through this material with the available equipment.",

    "A total of 71 palynology samples were prepared at the British Geological Survey using standard preparation procedures (Moore et al., 1991). Samples were demineralised with hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids, and residual mineral grains removed using heavy liquid (zinc bromide) separation. Elvacite was used to mount slides. The palynomorphs were analysed using a Nikon transmitted light microscope, counting the total number of palynomorphs on a strew slide (Table S1). Each slide was produced from 1/100th of the total material processed, where the initial weight of material was 5 g of dried sediment. Thus, the palynology counts represent the total number of specimens per 0.05 g of dried sediment. Statistical analysis was carried out using the software of Hammer et al. (2005). The %wood/plant tissue was determined by palynological investigation, and is the sum of ‘%wood plant tissue’ and ‘%various (non-woody) plant tissue’ in Table S1. Organic material for δ13CAOM analysis was collected from the same palynology samples, and the remaining processed material separated into size fractions. The >250 μm fractions, found through light microscope analysis to be dominated (>90%) by amorphous organic matter (AOM), were also analysed for δ13C. Foraminifera samples between 20 and 60 g of dried sediment were processed by washing through a 63 μm sieve with water. All specimens were counted and converted to foraminifera/g (Table S2).

Each questionnaire item enquires about a specific symptom, with response categories scored as either 1 or 0 to indicate whether the symptom is present. Total score of 5 or more led to individuals being defined as GHQ-symptom cases and scores 0 to 4 as noncases (27). Although the GHQ was originally designed to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, a recent population-based study showed GHQ caseness to be sensitive (84%) and specific (84%) in detecting dysthymia or major depressive disorder, as indicated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (28). The GHQ has also been validated at baseline against a clinical interview schedule in the Whitehall II study, with acceptable sensitivity (73%) and specificity (78%) (27). In a more recent validation using a subgroup of 274 participants aged 58 to 70 in 2010, the sensitivity and specificity of GHQ symptom caseness against diagnosed depressive episodes based on a structured psychiatric interview were 80% and 81%, respectively.",

The trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem receive afferent innervation from the trigeminal sensory ganglion that is relayed to the contralateral thalamus. The pons was selected as site for transplantation, because it is surgically accessible and located within proximity of the trigeminal brain stem nuclei that receive afferent input from the trigeminal ganglia. Hence, GFP+ human trigeminal neuron clusters were injected into adult NOD/SCID mice via stereotactic surgery (see Experimental Procedures). Histological analysis 4 weeks after transplantation showed survival of GFP+ human cell graft in the ventral pons (Figure S5E). Although GFP+ cell bodies remained tightly clustered at injection site, GFP+ fibers showed extensive projections into the host brain (n = 6) including the endogenous trigeminal nuclei (Figure S5F). Expression of BRN3A confirmed the sensory neuron identity of the cells (Figure S5G). Graft-derived human fiber bundles (hNCAM+ and GFP+) were observed emanating from the graft core (Figure S5H).
